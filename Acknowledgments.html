<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">I</span> would like to thank those who read and critiqued previous drafts of this book: Zahra Akbarzadeh, Jeremy Bartz, Isabella Bates, Steve Bates, Diane Byster, Linda Campbell, Tim Campbell, Terry DiNuzzo, Allan Gold, Kathleen Golding, Maury Joseph, Binnie Krystal-Anderson, John Lagerquist, Cindy Leavitt, Judy Maris, Tobias Nordqvist, Peter Reder, Maggie Silberstein, Joseph Sokal, Alvin Stenzel, and, especially, Linda Gilbert, without whom this book could not have become what it is. Tony Rousmaniere deserves thanks for suggesting I write this book. And thanks are due Mary Holmes for providing a wonderful place to write. I would also like to thank Peter Fenner for our conversations, the light from which shines throughout the book. Needless to say, any flaws or errors in the book are mine alone. I would also like to thank my previous therapists, supervisors, patients, and teachers whose examples have been an ever-present inspiration to me in my life and work. And, finally, I must express my deepest gratitude to the person who taught me the real meaning of embrace, my wife, Kath.<a id="page_160"></a></p>
