<p class="noindentt">“With a blast of truth, Frederickson—a world-class psychotherapy teacher—lays out the essentials of effective therapy. With clarity, a brilliant writing style, and many real-life examples, he shows us how a connection to the truth breaks down the walls and barriers that keep us from having a loving connection with others. <em>The Lies We Tell Ourselves</em> is destined to be a classic enjoyed by sensitive people (and their therapists) for generations to come.”</p>
<p class="bq">—Thomas M Brod, MD, Distinguished Fellow, American Psychiatric Association, and Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles</p>
<p class="noindentt">“In <em>The Lies We Tell Ourselves</em>, master clinician Jon Frederickson affords us a front-row seat to witness the dramatic changes that can take place when we have the courage to let go of our defenses, embrace our true feelings, and step into our lives in a more honest way. You’re sure to be inspired.”</p>
<p class="bq">—Ronald J. Frederick, PhD, psychologist and author of <em>Living Like You Mean It</em></p>
<p class="noindentt">“<em>The Lies We Tell Ourselves</em> explodes our illusions so we might come into true, authentic relationship with ourselves and others, the essence of love. The world is full of distortion and avoidance, but Jon creates a startling space where emotional truth can be fearlessly spoken. His writing has the feel of both psychological and spiritual mastery. His brilliant, richly informed, hard-fought, and gritty wisdom is a gift to us all.”</p>
<p class="bq">—Susan Warshow, MSW, DEFT Institute</p>
<p class="noindentt"><a id="page_b"></a>“In his latest book, <em>The Lies We Tell Ourselves</em>, Jon Frederickson shows us how we can face the truth of our lives so we can live fully engaged with the world and not with our fantasies of how we would like things to be. Basing his work on common struggles that each of us face, he shows us how to wrestle with and not avoid the existential issues that are inherently human and that derive from consciousness, such as death anxiety, loneliness, fear of abandonment, and isolation.”</p>
<p class="bq">—Jeffrey J. Magnavita, PhD, ABPP, Past President, Division of Psychotherapy, American Psychological Association</p>
<p class="noindentt">“Simply reading the loving wisdom in this masterful book by Jon Frederickson is perfect preparation for everyone who is contemplating psychotherapy or who wishes to re-engage therapy at a new level. Mental health and caregiving professionals will also benefit.</p>
<p class="indenta">“The vignettes in this book take us straight into the sacred space of Jon’s rooms where we can fully appreciate the smooth, loving, dextrous, surprising, and profoundly transformative ways in which he accompanies clients through the tragedies of life—loss, separation, divorce, grief, suicide, addiction—into authentic wholeness and fulfillment.</p>
<p class="indenta">“I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone who wants to see what therapy is really about or who wants to increase the value of the psychotherapy they engage in or offer to others.</p>
