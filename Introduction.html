<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">A</span> woman sat down in my office, sighed, and said, “I don’t know what to do about my marriage. My husband keeps having affairs. We’ve been in couples therapy, but it hasn’t done any good. He feels guilty, or at least that’s what he says. But every time he promises to be faithful, he gets involved with another woman. I should leave, but it’s easier to stay in the marriage than to divorce.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He promises to be faithful but then gets involved with other women?” I replied.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Would it be fair to say that you stay with the man who promises and try to forget the man who has affairs?”</p>
<p class="indent">“But I can’t forget!”</p>
<p class="indent">“You can’t forget the facts, but it sounds like you have been marrying his promises.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s harsh!”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s not my intent to be harsh. Have your husband’s affairs been harsh to your wish for faithfulness?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“And if you believe his words instead of his deeds, will believing his words be hard on you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I see what you mean.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If I see you hurting yourself, ignoring a behavior you need to see, do I have your permission to point that out so we can bring your suffering to an end?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_2"></a>“When you put it that way, it makes sense. But we don’t sleep together anymore.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I understand you don’t sleep with <em>him</em> anymore. But since you are still with him,” I paused, “is it possible you are living with his <em>lies</em>?”</p>
<p class="indent">Her eyes filled with tears. “How do I leave him?”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t need to. The <em>faithful</em> husband already left. Would you like me to help you stop waiting for him to come back?”</p>
<p class="indent">This woman hoped her faith would make her husband faithful, but it didn’t. Why did she lie to herself? Why do <em>all of us</em> lie to ourselves? It’s easier to embrace our wish than what is here. As the woman’s therapist, I wouldn’t find out in this session why she embraced her husband’s lies. And I might not find out why in the next session either, since meanings unfold over time.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how much we learn about someone, that person will always be a mystery. So if a person is a mystery, psychotherapy is a mystery meeting a mystery.</p>
<p class="indent">Why do we go to therapists? With the decline of traditional religions, we increasingly turn to healers to get help, end our suffering, and find meaning in life. Therapy for many has become a secular confessional. While wanting to change internally, we ask others to help us avoid change by validating us, fixing us, or advising us on how to change others. Therapists, drawn by a calling to heal, may correct our logic, listen while we say what comes to mind, or offer insights, but while each of these is an essential ingredient in therapy, none by itself is therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">A therapeutic relationship cannot be merely a method, a technique, or an act done <em>to</em> us. To heal we must be devoted to discovering the truths we avoid. And we avoid them through the lies we tell each other and ourselves. We don’t need advice. We need to delve underneath the lies to find what we have been looking for.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_3"></a>We don’t need to be fixed. We may think we need to fix ourselves, but often we are trying to fix our fantasies instead, the broken illusions, shattered self-images, and distorted ideas creating our suffering. Only by letting go of the false can we experience the real. Then we can accept ourselves and rediscover the vitality we lost through our lies.</p>
<p class="indent">A wise therapist does not simply talk about our thinking. Therapy is not a head-to-head relationship. A wise therapist does not sit silently while we prattle on, engage in chitchat, or say what comes to mind no matter what. If saying what came to mind mended people, saloons would long ago have healed humanity. A wise therapist does not rely on insight alone, for an insight from the head will not heal the pain in our hearts. How does healing happen?</p>
<p class="indent">The therapist invites us to experience who we are under the words, the excuses, and the explanations. We embrace our inner life (our urges, thoughts, and feelings) and the outer world, hidden from us by the lies we have believed about others and ourselves. And by facing what we have been hiding from, we go through the inner challenge known as healing.</p>
<p class="indent">If knowledge is the food of the soul, as Plato claimed, then healing happens when we bear what we avoid so knowledge can arise. Pills, shots, and electroshock are not substitutes for the living relationship that therapy can be. This book shows how facing what we avoid can heal us. The examples drawn from my practice present people struggling with the problems everyone has, using the excuses everyone uses, and demonstrate how, together with the therapist, people can bear the unbearable to face what they formerly feared.</p>
<p class="indent">Through a series of vignettes we will explore this encounter between two people where a patient heals through a heart-to-heart <a id="page_4"></a>meeting with a therapist. Although patients may ask for advice and repeat clichés, they long for who they are buried beneath their suffering. What is the knowledge they seek? These days when the concept of truth is often discarded, why do people keep seeking the truth in this embrace known as psychotherapy?</p>
