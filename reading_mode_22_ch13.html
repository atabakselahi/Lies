<p class="noindent"><span class="drop">“H</span>e just doesn’t fit into our social circle. His mannerisms are rude.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Her work habits are fine, but have you noticed what a loner she is? You’ll never catch her around the coffee pot in the morning, chatting with the rest of us.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Hey, have you seen that new guy in math class? Where’d he get those clothes he wears? What a dork!”</p>
<p class="indent">Social conformity opens the doors to group interaction. And, while we don’t want to make people with ASD into something they’re not, people with ASD have to be taught—or as adults they need to accept—this unwritten rule of social relationships: <i>the outside package is just as important as what’s inside</i>. Before you even get close enough for conversation, people are forming opinions of you based on what they see. Think back to the previous chapter about things that turn people off. A lot of them have to do with that outside package—the way you dress, the manner in which you carry yourself, your total outward appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">Autism makes social interaction difficult enough, especially once you do get to the point that you need to say something, when conversation is needed to keep the encounter unfolding. Arriving at the scene
<a id="page_352"></a>
with two strikes against you will, more often than not, find you striking out at the plate. Do that a few hundred times and no team will want you as a member.</p>
<p class="indent">Dressing to fit in is a skill that reigns supreme during adolescence and takes on a decidedly more civil tone once kids age out of school. That’s the good news. The bad news is that dressing to fit in is such a critical part of middle and high school, the peer “fashion-police” are ever vigilant during those years, that this must not be overlooked by parents and teachers in working with adolescents with ASD. From a social perspective, it should even be built into a student’s IEP goals. Even sensory issues can be accommodated; there are so many clothing options available today, and trends change so quickly, that most teens with ASD can find a style of dressing that allows them to fit in and be comfortable.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="h2"><b><i>Temple Comments:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">An important aspect of Rule #9 applies to fitting in by wearing clothing that is situation appropriate, neat and clean. It doesn’t mean everyone has to dress like clones of each other, but it does mean learning a couple of rather important unwritten rules:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:1.9em;">
<li>People form impressions about you based on the way you dress.</li>
<li>During the highly social years of middle and high school, dressing outside the norm will make you the subject of teasing and bullying, absolutely and always.</li>
<li>Society expects you to follow the formal or informal “dress code” for the event or the setting. When you’re young, society expects your parents to take care of this for you. As you become a teen or adult, society expects you to master this grooming basic.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">That first unwritten rule may seem unfair—that the way you look is apparently as important, or in some instances, more important, than
<a id="page_353"></a>
your personality or your intelligence. But it’s a fact of social interaction that just has to be accepted; it’s real life in action. Learning how to dress appropriately is pretty easy to do, though, and there are lots of people and resources that can help. You can look at what people in your age group are wearing in magazines; there are books about dressing for success in the workforce; you can ask coworkers to help you modify your wardrobe or most clerks in clothing stores are willing to help you put appropriate outfits together. And, there’s always observation, whether it’s of classmates, coworkers or special occasion situations. Like it or not, other people view what you wear as an expression of who you are, your personality, and how you view yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, as an adult I adopted my western themed shirts and pants style because it worked for me from a sensory perspective, it fit into my line of work, and I liked it. It might be called eccentric, but I’ve learned to make it work within social boundaries. I have expensive, very dressy shirts and pants for more formal occasions and other shirts and jeans to wear when I’m out on a construction site. I don’t own a dress. To keep my sensory oversensitivity under control, all jeans are washed several times before wearing and I wear old, soft t-shirts under the dressy shirts. Another example: I met an astronomy professor who was an Aspie. He had long hair, but it was clean and pulled back into a neat ponytail, and he wore nice blue jeans and a really cool astronomy t-shirt when he was teaching. That was fine. He was a science nerd and proud to be one. He was very good in his field, and his dress was appropriate for the college setting. He may have been eccentric, but he wasn’t sloppy. That’s the difference in whether your appearance helps you fit in or not as an adult.</p>
<p class="indent">When I’m meeting a new client, I make sure to look my best, because here’s another unwritten rule: <i>first impressions are lasting impressions</i>. If you blow the first encounter—you arrive dressed inappropriately, you say something really wrong during the first few minutes of chitchat, or
<a id="page_354"></a>
your behavior is obviously odd in some way—it’s an upward battle to change that person’s mind about you. Again, not fair, but reality. So, I take extra care to pick out appropriate clothes, go over in my mind what to say, and watch my mannerisms during that first meeting. The total picture has to work. Just looking the part isn’t good enough to keep the social interaction progressing smoothly. If you can’t do the meet-and-greet thing or control your own behaviors that will create a negative impression too. But never underestimate the power of looking like you fit it.</p>
<p class="indent">People with ASD do have sensory issues that need to be taken into account, but there are so many clothing options available now that most of the time, this can be circumvented and appropriate styles can be found nevertheless. Trouble arises because a lot of Aspies themselves don’t place much importance on what other people wear or how they look, and consequently they don’t pay attention to hygiene, they dress like a slob or wear mismatched clothes, or clothes that don’t fit. Whenever I see an Aspie peer who is doing that I get right on them. People did that with me, and even though I didn’t like it at the time and it hurt my feelings, I realize now that it was a big help for me in the long run. You can be angry about social expectations, over how you should dress and not want to conform, and you’ll keep turning people off. That’s a choice you can make, but if your goal is to have successful social relationships across various settings, you need to get over that anger and just accept the fact that how you look is part of fitting in. Eccentric is okay; being a slob is not. And note that this isn’t an expectation for only those of us with ASD; this same “rule” applies to everyone in a particular situation. If you work in a suit and tie environment, you wear a suit and tie, autism or no autism.</p>
<p class="indent">Another unwritten rule about how you look that I only learned later in life is that <i>people treat you differently—better—when you respect the dress code of the setting</i>. For instance, I’ve learned that when I dress up
<a id="page_355"></a>
at the airport I’m more likely to get an upgrade. I used to wear pretty sloppy clothes when I traveled, but I no longer do that. I’m treated differently when I look nice and there are tangible benefits to doing so. Also, people are recognizing me more often now since the release of the HBO movie, <i>Temple Grandin</i>. Almost every time I fly somewhere, someone recognizes me and comes over to talk, so I don’t want to be seen in the airport looking sloppy. That would not create a good impression. When you take a bigger role within a community, like the autism community, or gain recognition professionally, there’s a certain social responsibility that comes with that in relation to the impression you make on others. You have to be more careful about what you do and say and look like. People expect that of you. It’s another one of those unwritten rules of social relationships: <i>the more recognition you achieve for your efforts, the more careful you have to be to look and act that part</i>. It takes a lot of self-monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent">“Looking the part” to the point of semi-conformity seems to be most important during the middle school years, partly because this is a time of social-emotional development in a typical child, when he aligns himself with his peers in an effort to establish his own identity and independence apart from his parents. Dressing too far outside what other peers consider fashionable that year (or season) will quickly single out the child for harassment and bullying. Once the adolescent makes it through these years and into being a young adult, the pressure to do this lessens dramatically. After adolescence, diversity becomes more respected and acknowledged, and individual styles (again, within the broad social conventions) are viewed in a better light.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">While it’s apparent that Temple’s approach to dressing arises from her logical, goal-oriented thinking patterns, Sean’s struggle with looking good arose from a much more deep-seated emotional well of low self-esteem.</p>
<a id="page_356"></a>
<div class="boxx">
<p class="h2"><b><i>Sean Shares:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">I didn’t spend any time during my middle or high school years trying to make a fashion statement, but had that been my ambition, I would have been grounded before pushing back from the gate. I consistently failed to follow the first step of “looking good,” which was to check my appearance in a mirror while getting dressed and before leaving for school each morning.</p>
<p class="indent">It wasn’t that I forgot that basic piece of etiquette; it was that I deliberately avoided it. The reason was simple yet complex: I usually hated the person staring back and didn’t want to look at him. As a result, I might as well have been a blind person trying to improvise the art of dressing and looking presentable, and the times I left for school looking good were more attributable to luck than a conscious effort on my part to ensure that that was the case.</p>
<p class="indent">My aversion to mirrors was so strong that for years I turned my head whenever I passed one. When I was in situations that required me to be next to one—like getting dressed—I looked above my reflection, to the side, at my lower body, anywhere but at my face. I remember a few occasions during my mid-teens when I made a conscious (and painful) effort to force myself to look at my reflection only to literally turn red with embarrassment. I couldn’t stand how I looked, how tall I was (I thought I towered over kids, another way I stood out) or what I was forced to be reminded of each time I took a peek. As I’ve mentioned in several places already in the book, I was convinced that I was an inherently bad person; looking in a mirror threw that reminder back in my face, literally.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s difficult to emerge from home looking your best when you have an acute case of mirror aversion combined with low self-esteem. For years I was teased and tormented in school for a variety of reasons. I realize that shortly after I arose each morning I helped set the wheels into motion to ensure this was a staple of my school day. Even before laying
<a id="page_357"></a>
eyes on the day’s first tormentors, my mother was using every means she could think of to get me to look at myself as I got dressed (“You have to look at what you’re doing,” “People notice how you look,” “If you want to make friends, you have to look presentable”), only to have me still reach the front door in the morning with my shirt collars up and my self-esteem down.</p>
<p class="indent">On days that I left for middle and high school looking okay largely because of her efforts, I usually came home looking anything but. That was because I had gym class most days, and on those days I was required to dress, undress and take a shower. Since I didn’t have my mother guiding me, and had a limited amount of time to dress before the next period’s bell rang, I did so hurriedly and away from a mirror that could keep me on course. I had greater motor difficulty with shirts that had a lot of buttons, especially smaller ones, and cuffs. In addition to mismatching the buttons to their proper holes, I often put on my shirt without having dried my back. I was a prime target for those who enjoyed making fun of me.</p>
<p class="indent">When I was made fun of I stewed inside, but rarely retaliated or thought about changing my behavior or learning the art of dressing. Instead, I took my pent-up fury out on the object I perceived was responsible for creating the conditions that allowed the incident to occur. In these instances, the shirt or pair of pants were to blame.</p>
<p class="indent">If shirts with buttons were hard to put on each morning, they were even more of a challenge to remove. When I came home, I tried to get them off not by unbuttoning each button, but by lifting them over my head. This way, I reasoned, I will get the process over with faster. If such shirts didn’t slide right over my head, my anger was unleashed and I ripped the buttons off, often throwing the shirt or pants away. Later, when I cooled off, I placed the clothing article at the bottom of the waste basket and put trash over the “offending” item hoping no one would notice. Someone always did, however.</p>
<a id="page_358"></a>
<p class="indent">As if all of that wasn’t enough, there was the sore issue of letters and numbers. I steadfastly refused to wear any clothing item that had writing on it. I had several shirts that contained logos and various expressions, and those were the ones that collected cobwebs in the drawer or closet. As a result, I constantly wore the same four or five shirts, the ones that were solid or had little color variation, regardless of whether they had holes worn into them or how they matched the rest of my outfit.</p>
<p class="indent">One day midway through eighth grade, my mother had had enough. I had a blue pullover shirt with red stripes that I wore a lot, and after wearing it for the fifth consecutive day, my mom let her feelings be known.</p>
<p class="indent">“Take that off!” she said at the bottom of the stairs when she saw me coming down.</p>
<p class="indent">Without saying a word, I returned to my room and replaced it with another shirt I wore nearly as often.</p>
<p class="indent">As I look back on those years, I realize that not only did I have no idea how my own clothing worked, I also had no idea about how other people dressed and why. People wore certain color or pattern combinations, for instance, and I hadn’t a clue about those. Also lost on me was the concept that, like certain behaviors, many types of clothing were appropriate in one setting and not okay in another.</p>
<p class="indent">I remember my grandmother’s funeral when I was fourteen, and that the men wore suits, ties and dark shoes, and the women attended wearing dresses and good-looking shoes. At the time, however, I didn’t know that such attire was appropriate for the sad occasion. Had my mother not picked out my outfit beforehand, I might have gone wearing what I wore around the house, even though it was February.</p>
<p class="indent">A person’s appearance, going for a job interview and taking someone out on a first date have one thing in common: They speak to the importance of first impressions. When I got older, during the time I was overcoming my autism and still had difficulty with some dressing issues,
<a id="page_359"></a>
I began to justify my refusal to take the extra time to look presentable by saying that true friends would accept me for who I am regardless of how I looked. As I learned, however, there’s no relationship between people’s unconditional acceptance of me and their being turned off by my poor appearance. Entering a social situation looking unacceptable is unattractive to others, regardless of how well they know the person with the turned-up collar and uncombed hair.</p>
<p class="indent">I don’t know if I fully subscribe to the saying that the clothes make the person. I do, however, buy into the idea that the clothes set up impressions about you in other people’s minds. So when it comes to getting dressed and wanting to create a good impression, I recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asking for help if you’re unsure about how an article of clothing looks with something else. On several occasions, I have asked my girlfriend if a particular shirt is color-coordinated with the pair of pants I have on. Asking someone else doesn’t mean I’m stupid or don’t know better; another opinion can help you think of something you hadn’t thought of before.</li>
<li>If anything, taking more, not less, time to look your best.</li>
<li>Paying close attention to hygiene. That means showering daily, washing your hair with each shower, if needed, and always using deodorant.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">I take great pride in dressing each morning and looking my best for whatever the day may bring. It’s one of those unwritten rules that abound: <i>looking good creates a positive tone to the social interaction and sets the stage for fitting in with those you encounter</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Temple offers a few other unwritten social rules she’s learned about looking and acting like you fit in.</p>
<a id="page_360"></a>
<div class="box">
<p class="h2"><b><i>Temple Says:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are lots of common, everyday social skills that people in general exhibit in order to get along with each and fit into society or a particular social group. For instance, here’s some unwritten rules about “fitting in” that I’ve learned from my experiences:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:1.9em;">
<li><i>People who are polite and cheerful will have an easier time getting along in the world</i>. That may not seem fair, but people like people who are generally happy.</li>
<li><i>Good manners are a must</i>. I know I’m repeating this over and over throughout the book, but that’s because they open so many doors to social interaction. I can’t impress strongly enough upon the parents and teachers reading this book the importance of drilling these basic social functioning skills into the child. Like the Nike ad says, “Just do it.”</li>
<li><i>Social interaction is a two-way street</i>, which means that you’re going to need to extend yourself out to others; to fit in you must initiate social contact some of the time.</li>
<li>At school or on the job, <i>greet your peers at least once each day</i>. It can be a simple gesture: make eye contact (or if that’s too difficult, just look at the space between their eyebrows) and say, “Hi, how’s it going?” or even just “Hi!”</li>
<li><i>Actively try to engage in some small talk with peers you interact with on a daily basis</i> (lab partners in science class, homeroom students, coworkers, etc.). While it’s not necessary to form friendships with all of these people, some social interaction is needed if you are to be viewed as fitting into the group.</li>
<li><i>Act the way you want people to view you</i>. Be friendly if you want friends. Be cooperative if you want cooperation from others. Acting depressed won’t attract happy people to you.</li>
</ul>
<a id="page_361"></a>
<p class="indent">I’ve used the analogy lots of times before that we’re actors in a play that is life. An important caveat to keep in mind is that <i>society is one of the directors of this play</i>. Society sometimes dictates the role you play in a certain scene, or how you’re supposed to play it. We don’t always get to do it the way we want to. There will be times the director requires we perform a certain way: that’s how life is, too. We’re expected to rehearse the part and learn to perform it—going through the motions even when we might not agree, or understand it 100%. It is an unwritten rule worth repeating: <i>Sometimes you just have to learn to perform the behaviors that allow you to fit in, like it or not</i>. This is troublesome for many of my peers with ASD. They want to be the sole director of their play. That’s impossible if you want to exist within any society and interact with others. It’s a group effort and you have to abide by the group rules.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In the following passages Sean echoes Temple’s words and moves forward to the second part of fitting into a social encounter: chitchat and small talk, which he refers to as the social glue of interaction.</p>
<div class="boxx">
<p class="h2"><b><i>Sean Speaks:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">If you have ever attended a Major League baseball game, much of your excitement probably comes from the knowledge that you’re seeing the best and most well-known players battling it out. Most of the top ball players have a knack for making tough plays look effortless and easy. Batters hit balls coming at them at 90 mph or more; infielders catch line drives that, if hit my way, would cause me to wonder whether my Blue Cross is paid up before I ducked first and asked questions later; and they perform in front of thousands of people every day.</p>
<p class="indent">But if you get to the ballpark, say an hour before game time, you also notice something else: the same players who make it look easy on the field are taking batting practice, doing stretches and other calisthenics
<a id="page_362"></a>
and going over the same skills and drills they likely learned back in their days of Little League. In other words, these professional baseball players don’t just take their positions, pick up a bat and go at it. Even after more than a month of spring training, they still practice and refine their abilities before all 162 regular season games. And the key to their success in the Major Leagues can be summed up in two words: making adjustments. The rules of the game are the same; it’s being flexible in playing each game that results in a win for the team.</p>
<p class="indent">I use this example to illustrate what I see as parallels between baseball and social skills. It took me many years of trial and error as well as pain, heartbreak and difficulties to learn what I have learned about relating well to people. One unwritten rule is this: <i>Whether or not a person has autism, fitting in socially requires that we each play by certain rules that form the structure of our society</i>. Within that framework, however, we each bring individual skills and talents that create the team’s personality. An equally important unwritten rule that is often difficult for the person with ASD to grasp is that <i>fitting in requires that I keep making adjustments to the interaction, based on the context of the situation in which I find myself. In essence, I adjust to the situation</i> instead of going into a situation and expecting it to adjust to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Like the player who undertakes batting practice before the game, I “warm up” to many social situations, as opposed to going into them full steam and with a mental “map” of how I want them to go. Not only were most social skills ones I understood much later than most people, but I also had to learn what a friend of the family refers to as the “social glue,” that is, words and phrases that cause people to feel comfortable around you and keep a conversation “glued” together and moving forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Chitchat and small talk are the glue. They are not necessarily the same as meaningless bantering or other types of idle conversation, however. Both are about more than filling time by simply discussing with a stranger in the supermarket the weather (although that can be okay, too)
<a id="page_363"></a>
or the latest blockbuster movie. Chitchat can be a valuable social tool; in it is a gold mine of catch phrases and early opportunities to create a favorable impression, thus setting up the possibility of hitting a homerun with another person or a group. It can lay a foundation for a friendship or other healthy relationship to be built. Allow me to use a few personal examples to illustrate my point.</p>
<p class="h1"><b>SAM BARZILLO</b></p>
<p class="noindent">At the beginning of seventh-grade, I somehow found the courage to do something uncharacteristically risky. I was proud of myself because during the first week of school, I initiated a conversation with a pupil seated directly behind me. We were seated in alphabetical order, so I was easily able to talk to Sam Barzillo by virtue of location. This simple act was nearly unprecedented, partly because I felt comfortable only with teachers and adults at school and rarely with those my own age. The few times I did initiate an interaction with another child were almost always an extension of or variation on one of my compulsions, which, of course, was the antithesis of an offer of friendship.</p>
<p class="indent">But on this occasion during homeroom, I found it within me to garner the courage to turn around and start talking to him. Even so, I did it only within a very narrow comfort zone. I was just a step or two away from stressing out—and dealing with this stress in classically autistic ways—if he crossed a line that forced me out of the zone.</p>
<p class="indent">Sure enough, that is exactly what happened. Sam, no doubt sensing that I was making an overture of friendship toward him, responded back to me in kind. However, the interaction quickly moved into uncharted social avenues for me. I didn’t understand that a back and forth banter about generic subjects was needed for people to become comfortable with one another. My communication arsenal didn’t include the friendly “I’d-like-to-get-to-know-you” conversation openers that most
<a id="page_364"></a>
kids pick up with ease. The whole idea of small talk was foreign to me; all talk was big talk and carried with it unspoken opportunities for pushing me outside my comfort zone.</p>
<p class="indent">I withdrew from Sam and began ignoring him, most likely reinforcing in his mind that I wasn’t friendship material after all, but a weirdo who didn’t know the first thing about fitting in. Not surprisingly, a potential friend became another tormenter, and my interactions with Sam evolved into needling and bullying that plagued me and intensified over the next two grades. Had I understood that the game of friendship requires that I step up to the plate with at least a few basic skills under my belt, Sam and I might have become teammates. As it was, my lack of skills resulted in my remaining a team of one.</p>
<p class="h1"><b>MY CHITCHAT EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS</b></p>
<p class="noindent">When I lived in California and was seventeen, my parents took me to see a play at the Victory Theater in Los Angeles. My folks heard about the performance through its director, whom my mom and dad knew casually. After the curtain went up and the final applause died down, we stuck around so they could thank the director, meet her husband, and have the two meet me. Little did the director realize that the real drama of that evening was yet to come.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’d like you both to meet our son, Sean,” my mother said to the director and her husband.</p>
<p class="indent">What followed was not the customary “Nice to meet you, too,” or any related variation. Instead, I responded by taking a large step backward and following that up with silence. I didn’t smile or in any way indicate I wanted anything to do with this couple. Did I instantly dislike them? Was I deliberately being mean? Did I have a vendetta against this man and this woman who let us see a play for free? The answer to all three was no. Nevertheless, my actions portrayed a boy who was cold,
<a id="page_365"></a>
rather hostile and unresponsive, and they undoubtedly wondered what was wrong with me.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though I had not set out to be unfriendly, these two kind people had no way of knowing what was going on behind my inappropriate reaction. Nor were they obligated to figure it out. During this time in the late 1970s, my self-esteem was more fragile than fine porcelain and even the slightest failure or negative reaction from someone—<i>real or perceived</i>—shattered it. To compensate, I developed a mask of sorts to handle the low opinion I had of myself. When I met new people, I waited for them to approach me and <i>prove</i> I was special. I wanted them to make me feel okay about who I was. This caused me to go into these situations with expectations of how people were to greet, respond and pay attention to me (all of which were unrealistic), and when they “failed” to “validate” that I was a terrific person, I reacted with coldness because, without any of these people knowing it, they had “shattered” what I was trying so hard to preserve.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, what should have been routine greetings turned into vicious circles because I reacted as I had, causing those who met me to sense something was wrong with me without knowing what. That in turn caused people to avoid me because they didn’t know how to handle such unusual and unexpected behavior. I interpreted their avoidance as not caring about me, which deepened my resentment and caused me to become even more obstinate.</p>
<p class="h1"><b>THE PRICELESS VALUE OF SMALL TALK</b></p>
<p class="noindent">It was in my junior year of high school that I experienced my first-ever peer group social situation. I, my sister, and three other of my high school classmates went out to dinner after school one afternoon. I had a lot of trepidation initially because I had never gone out with anyone my age before, yet part of me was excited because I was entering uncharted waters.</p>
<a id="page_366"></a>
<p class="indent">During the dinner, the other three teenagers were kind to me and made efforts to include me in the conversation. I didn’t know how to use lead-ins to start a conversation with anyone, so I mostly sat back and tried to appropriately respond to their overtures. I was pleasant to them because I wanted friends so badly and even though the meal was punctuated by many awkward moments, the group didn’t seem fazed and continued to reach out to me. I suspect they knew I had autism.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, the evening went well and I came home thrilled that, despite every fiber in my body telling me not to go, I overcame my fear. But when I now look back on that evening, I recall what was missing from my social repertoire: small talk and conversation openers, the keys that open doors to social relationships.</p>
<p class="indent">So what’s the big deal about chitchat and making small talk with people? Why not just skip over the preliminaries and cut to the chase already? I have found that it makes no difference whether you have known a person for two minutes or two years; such “social glue” is valuable because it:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:1.9em;">
<li>Creates in the other person an early impression of you. Meeting someone, making eye contact, smiling and simply saying things like “How are you?” “That’s a really nice outfit you’re wearing,” “Hey, you look great,” etc., tells the other person you’re open and approachable. Many solid friendships I now have began with chatting in some form; indeed, it’s how all friendships start out.</li>
<li>Makes it easier to continue the social interaction with another person. Simply saying, for example, “My, that tie looks good on you,” pays a compliment to the person, and it’s an unwritten rule of social interaction: <i>most people enjoy receiving compliments</i>. Compliments also open the door for the conversation to go in many possible directions. Maybe you have a tie that looks like the one the person you have just met is wearing and a conversation can come from that. Perhaps that statement or one like it could
<a id="page_367"></a>
spawn a conversation about ties, which can lead elsewhere. One time at work, I ran into a co-worker who was wearing an ostentatious checkered tie and I went up to him, unprompted, and said, “I love that getup you’re wearing. I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t have a tie exactly like that one.” The other person laughed and we parted with good feelings. So a few words or a single sentence can lead a conversation in any of a million directions—all desirable ones—instead of having it stall at each red light like a poorly tuned car.</li>
<li>Allows interactions with people to run more naturally, smoothly and rhythmically. Somehow, simple chitchat often puts people at ease and when you do get to the more serious topics (asking someone on a date, for a favor or countless other possibilities), it doesn’t seem forced.</li>
<li>Shows interest. Remember, it is more attractive—and you make a better and longer lasting impression—to show interest than to try so hard to be interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">For years, I reacted to uncomfortable situations with silence. During the same time, I clung to the mistaken notion that silence was just that—a void, empty of meaning. Regardless of how hard I tried to remove myself from that uncomfortable situation by retreating into myself, I always gave off something negative that those in my presence felt and picked up on every time. In itself, this is another unwritten rule of social interaction: <i>being silent is a form of communication all its own</i>. There are appropriate and inappropriate times and places for being silent. Inappropriate silence speaks volumes and the old adage, “silence is golden” doesn’t always apply.</p>
<p class="indent">People subjected to my coldness and silence backed off not because they were uncaring or unfeeling, but because they didn’t know what else to do. They may not have known what was ticking inside my head, but they certainly were privy to the fact that something was amiss.</p>
<a id="page_368"></a>
<p class="indent">And throughout all of it, one unwritten rule of social relationships stood strong: no one wants to be around someone who consistently gives off negative energy. Each time I stepped up to the plate with that response, I struck out.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the social rules of chitchat are more nebulous.</p>

<p class="h2"><b><i>Temple Points Out:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">Sean has offered a lot of good information on the value of chitchat in social interactions, and his personal examples demonstrate how it can make or break social relationships. In my experience, there are a few other related unwritten rules about making small talk that I think are important to discuss. One is this: <i>people chitchat as a way of being polite with each other in social settings, but many people don’t expect you to thoroughly address a question, or even be 100% honest in your answer</i>. This does vary from person to person, and it depends on how well you know the person. But for instance, the stranger who says, “Hi, how are you?” isn’t expecting you to talk on about the fact that you just had the flu and the doctor gave you a shot and you were throwing up for three days. The appropriate response is a short, “Fine,” or you might say, “I’ve been sick but I’m feeling better now, thank you.” This is a time when 100% honesty can be a turn-off if you launch into a detailed description of your ailments.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s another unwritten rule about small talk: <i>the less you know the person, the more the conversation is comprised of short, generic questions and/or statements</i>. Social conversation unfolds, like a flower unfolds its petals in the sun, based on how little or how well you know the person. With strangers, questions and answers start out short and generic. They go back and forth as people gauge interest in each other and surmise how much they might have in common. Back to the stranger on the
<a id="page_369"></a>
airplane who I talked about in Rule 8: after the initial introductions and chitchat about where we’re both going, I might next talk about some travel war stories of mine and test if that’s a subject of shared interest. Most people who travel a lot have them. I keep the story short until I can see if the person’s engaged or not. Short, one word responses like “interesting” or “really?” or “hmm” indicate disinterest, as the person isn’t asking another question or offering any information back to me of his own. If I want to continue with our interaction, I might try another topic. One sure sign that he wants the conversation between us to end is when he starts reading a magazine, or unpacking his laptop, while I’m still talking. At that point, I know he’s no longer interested. Now, I don’t take that personally, and automatically assume I’ve done something wrong. There could be lots of reasons that have nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="indent">With someone you don’t know very well, polite chitchat is the starting point to conversation. It can lead to more meaningful exchanges if you both hit upon a topic of mutual interest. Or, the social interaction can be no more than chitchat. Either way, it’s a skill that when mastered, lets you fit in with all different types of people, across different settings and cultures. It’s a universal unwritten rule of social relationships.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Humor is next on the list of ways to fit in, and one of the most difficult social skills to master. It’s highly context driven, demands a good ability to read the situation and the responses of other people (both verbal and nonverbal), and to be successfully used, requires spot-on timing. Sean has accepted the challenge of conveying the pitfalls of using humor and eventually feeling the power of it as a conversational vehicle to fit into a social group.</p>

<div class="boxx">
<p class="h2"><b><i>Sean Speaks:</i></b></p>
<p class="noindent">In the mid-’70s, I was fascinated with the popular television show of that era, <i>Gilligan’s Island</i>. Each day at 4:00 <small>PM</small> I was counting on the silliness of Bob Denver and the other characters to be my ticket out of unhappiness. I spent an unusually large amount of time that year at the kitchen table, turning on the tiny black-and-white screen to memorize dialogue and become funny.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides air, food and water, I needed a sense of humor, and I was willing to try any means necessary to achieve it. Nothing else was working to get me out from under the heavy burdens of unhappiness, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and fantasies and unpopularity at school, so I figured that developing the ability to make others laugh would dramatically shift their opinions of me from negative to positive and counteract the effects of bullying and emotional pain. Humor would be my free pass to fitting in with my peers.</p>
<p class="indent">My plan was the essence of simplicity: just take note of and memorize those chunks of dialogue that result in audience laughter and use them myself in conversations with people at home, school and elsewhere. Even in the haze of autism, I knew this unwritten rule among social partners: <i>funny people are attractive people</i>. And in my case, an ability to get my middle school classmates laughing harder and longer would go a long way toward reversing a self-history fraught and littered with despair and suicidal ideations.</p>
<p class="indent">I never spent a moment of my teenage years wondering about the show’s lack of reality, how the seven people functioned as they did in such a setting and kept their sense of humor and wits when faced with the world’s worst luck. Nor did I stop to wonder how the three women stayed so beautiful and proper without the barest essentials at their fingertips, like electricity to wash their beautiful and proper clothes. It never occurred to me to question how that many people, stuck indefinitely
<a id="page_371"></a>
on an island I literally thought was real and in the middle of the South Pacific somewhere—so real that I once tried to find it on my globe— could never run out of supplies.</p>
<p class="indent">In much the same way, I was identifying various television commercials I found funny to pick out those delicious bits of humor that would make me equally appealing to my classmates. These included the ads for Kool-Aid® drink mix and Sugar Crisp® cereal. Here I went a huge (and sometimes painful) step further by trying to imitate the character’s movements, as well as tone of voice and articulations. I remember the person dressed up as the Kool-Aid pitcher breaking down a wall and making his presence felt and I tried, at home and at school, everything short of putting a life-size hole in a classroom wall to mimic that opening scene. So now I had two ways to add to my humor arsenal. I would surely fit in now at school. How could I miss?</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, I went 0-for-2. Instead of throwing a dart and hitting the bulls-eye, I was unwittingly tossing a boomerang. The very things I thought should be funnier through repetition were the same pieces of script that were increasingly driving people around me crazy and further alienating me. In a short time, my sister Meg got to where she couldn’t stand the sight or sound of these and other commercials and my family’s opinion of <i>Gilligan’s Island</i>, poor at the starting gate, plummeted. Not only was no one in the family laughing, but they were also getting angrier. I couldn’t understand how someone else could view something that was hilarious to me in any other way than how I saw it.</p>
<p class="indent">Likewise, I had no way of being able to judge whether those who did laugh at my antics were laughing with me or at me. Laughter was laughter and was always accompanied by a smile, both of which meant something good. It meant that whoever was laughing was finding me funny, period. Even though I could sometimes sense if someone’s laughter was meant to convey, “You’re weird” instead of “I think you’re funny
<a id="page_372"></a>
and I like your humor,” I couldn’t definitely rely on any internal signs or signals to clue me in to what was going on.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, as time went on and my humor value dropped, it became painfully clear that two things were happening: one, the arguments, not laughter, between me and my family were accounting for the bulk of decibels at home and two, the scant number of kids who seemed to like me was decreasing. I could tell that I was more and more in disfavor at school because many kids would preempt or try to one-up me. They would mock me by repeating snips from the commercials or other sayings I came up with on my own before I opened my mouth. And I had no idea how to be funny or where to go with it when I was in the position of having to respond to what someone else said; my attempts at humor relied solely on my initiating them and the humor unfolding in a carefully scripted manner. In these situations, I would become visibly frustrated and red, which would only act to spur them on—turning an opportunity for humor into yet another source of torment.</p>
<p class="indent">I had no way of knowing it at the time, but the chief culprits for humor dissolving into misery were not my lack of material or exaggerated movements per se, but my inability to put anything in perspective, as well as an abundance of literal and boxed thinking. Such a mindset told me that all I had to do to be funny—and win the hearts of hundreds—was copy what was viewed as funny on TV. After all, if a given character said something that led to laughter, then it stood to reason that repeating those words would yield the same results. Nevertheless, what this mindset prevented me from getting was one of the unwritten rules of social relationships: that <i>humor only works in context</i>. Yes, a certain chunk of dialogue may be hilarious in one setting, but the precise words or actions in another context may be insulting, hurtful or inappropriate. Calling someone names on a TV show may be funny to those looking in, but doing the same thing in the wrong setting is more likely to get you punched than make you popular. And repeating
<a id="page_373"></a>
the same joke, commercial or dialogue to the same person makes it less funny—something that took me a long time to understand.</p>
<p class="indent">Copying other people—whether from television shows or real life—in order to fit in never got me what I truly wanted. Instead, it got me into trouble with myself because I had to live up to impossible and unreasonable expectations that caused enormous disappointment, anger and heartbreak. The important caveat of Rule #9 I learned, that is in itself another unwritten rule of social relationships, was this: <i>I can dress like others, talk like others and act like others in an attempt to fit in, and a measure of that is needed in order to do so. But long-lasting social acceptance comes from liking yourself enough to let your own unique personality shine though. That’s how you truly fit in</i>.</p>
<p class="indent">It took me a long time to realize that spontaneity is humor’s lifeblood. When I got older and was beginning to emerge from my shell of autism, my sense of humor was blossoming. However, even then I still went into a given social situation planning ahead what I would say to make those I interact with laugh. I would play in my head something I thought was funny and would come home in the evening disappointed or feeling at a loss if I forgot to say it. The same feelings—along with a shot of embarrassment—resulted if I did manage to say what I thought were the humorous words only to be met with a cool or tepid response or no laughter. I took such dashed expectations personally. I still didn’t comprehend the importance of being spontaneous in such situations and still had a long way to go to learn that humor is not something one can usually “plan.”</p>
<p class="indent">Through this journey to develop my sense of humor, I learned a very important lesson, an unwritten rule that applies to using humor in a relationship: <i>never use sarcasm or any other style or form of humor to deliberately hurt someone or at their expense</i>. That’s never funny and will end a social interaction quicker than anything.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s another unwritten rule that became apparent to me as I emerged from my autism: <i>Being able to laugh at your own gaffes,
<a id="page_374"></a>
miscues, mistakes and shortcomings certainly helps maintain—and in some instances, repair—a social relationship</i>. For me, perhaps this was the hardest thing of all to learn—and it’s something I still on occasion have to remind myself to do. It also goes a long way toward diffusing a potentially negative situation before it can ruin an evening, date, dinner or day.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s not been easy to learn these and many other social-emotional life lessons. I had to go through years of trial and error and literally start by taking Relating to Others 101, which had watching how people greet each other, smiling and looking natural and laughing appropriately on its syllabus. I’ve discovered that having an ability to make others laugh and spread joy that way is a valuable means to fitting in with others. But humor, in and of itself, is not an end to strive for. The end is being able to establish positive, vibrant, healthy and long-lasting relationships with people on many levels.</p>

<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:1em;"><b>2017 REFLECTIONS FROM SEAN</b></p>
<p class="indent2">As was the case with becoming more adept at navigating through Rule #7, my journalism career has provided the perfect set of opportunities to more fully grasp and appreciate the link between fitting in somewhere and appearing as if I do. Knowing what to do and how to conduct myself after having been asked to cover an event, a meeting or other public gathering for our newspaper has a lot in common with knowing how to prepare for a social outing, and a key component of both is having the ability to keep an open mind. If I cover, say, a county commissioners’ meeting, I go into it open-mindedly and base my story on what’s most newsworthy, along with what I feel will be most interesting to our readers, not necessarily on what I personally might think is most important or captivating.</p>
<a id="page_375"></a>
<p class="indent3">Likewise, this is how I try to approach social situations. For one, I love to make others laugh – without striving to be the center of attention – but at the same time, I have to take into account that not every social gathering lends itself to laughter. I may be in a wonderful mood, but the overall tone of a given setting could be somber and sad, so obviously it’s up to me to make the appropriate adjustments, which may mean trying to help others feel better instead of trying to inject humor. Any social gathering is, by definition, a collection of what everyone brings to the table, and I have only a finite amount of control over a setting.</p>
<p class="indent3">Following this trajectory does not mean pretending to be something you’re not or betraying your true self. It entails adjusting to the myriad of situations that life throws your way, which leads to further personal growth.</p>
<p class="indent3">In her Peer Spectrum classes, Jennifer Schmidt points out to her students the subtleties of this social rule, things that most neurotypical people adapt to but are often confusing and challenging to those on the spectrum. Through outside class activities and field trips in a variety of settings such as the local mall, she ensures that her students on the spectrum learn that this social skill also depends heavily on who is part of the equation, how well others in the situation are known, the participants’ ages and the environment. Taking into account that complicated, nuanced social opportunities can be highly confusing and frustrating for those with literal, black-and-white thinking patterns, Schmidt also uses role playing as a means to help her students grapple with this concept so they have the tools to better fit in wherever they may be and whomever’s company they may keep.</p>
</div>
<a id="page_376"></a>
<p class="h1"><b>POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND:</b></p>
<ul style="margin-left:0.6em;">
<li>Neurotypical people often throw out questions as part of “social chitchat” that they really don’t want a long or involved answer to. Be sure to share that caveat when teaching aspects of social conversation.</li>
<li>Sensory issues can interfere with appearance and grooming; find age-appropriate ways to help the child fit in while still working within their sensory sensitivities.</li>
<li>Teaching age-appropriate language to fit in will mean also teaching children the slang words and expressions, whether or not the teacher/adult feels they are “right.”</li>
<li>Fitting in requires the ASD individual to adapt to social convention; at times the rules may seem silly or unimportant to him. Remind the ASD individual that sometimes it’s just the “part” he needs to play in order to be a part of a social group/interaction.</li>
<li>Respect the ASD person’s individuality and help him express it within socially accepted boundaries. Changing him into a neurotypical “clone” is not the goal of intervention.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">What is “humorous” varies from culture to culture, from company to company, teacher to teacher, etc. It’s highly situation and context driven—and will be difficult for the child with ASD who thinks literally to appreciate.</p>
