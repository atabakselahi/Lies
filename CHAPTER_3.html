<h2 class="h2">The Refusal to Embrace</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">H</span>aving looked at the reasons we tell ourselves lies, we can examine the ways we deceive ourselves and distort reality. Rather than let go of our lies and face the truths they hide, we often refuse to embrace the truths of our inner and outer lives. We will explore the ways we ignore the parts of reality we don’t want to see—how we oppose them, relocate them, or try to change them. Each of these lies causes suffering in its own pernicious way, resulting in different forms of blindness.</p>
<p class="indent">A therapist will not collude with our defenses but show us how they cause our suffering. Then we can embrace the truths of our inner life (our feelings, thoughts, and wishes) and our outer life (reality). This task, never easy and always painful, is made bearable when we bear it together.</p>
<h3 class="h3">“You Keep Forcing Me!”</h3>
<p class="noindent">What if the refusal to embrace our outer life reflects the refusal to embrace our inner life? Opposing others may be how we oppose ourselves. What if outer conflict mirrors an internal war?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_54"></a>People may create a conflict with us to avoid a conflict within themselves. For instance, an unemployed man entered my office, sat back in the chair, rested his arms on the armrest, and waited for me to begin. “I notice you are looking at me expectantly,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You’re the therapist. What am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Nothing. What do you <em>want</em> to work on for <em>your</em> benefit?”</p>
<p class="indent">“If I knew the answer, I wouldn’t be here. I’m out of a job. I haven’t been looking. And my wife is bent out of shape that I stay home playing on the computer.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I understand your wife is bent out of shape, but what do <em>you</em> want me to help you with.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t know. I don’t trust myself anymore. I’ve been in other therapies and nothing worked. I feel like I have to do what you say; otherwise I won’t get better.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If you do what <em>I</em> want, you will get better at submitting to people and making yourself miserable.”</p>
<p class="indent">“My point, exactly! I didn’t want to come, but I’m worried about what you will make me do.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I can’t make you do anything. I can ask questions, and you can answer them or not. It sounds like you might make yourself do therapy when you don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I have to force myself because it would be good for me. You would say I won’t make progress unless I do this.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You distrust your no to therapy and try to submit to me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I view your invitation as a forcing function where you coerce me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I can’t coerce you to do what you don’t want; only <em>you</em> can coerce yourself. Is this a pattern, making yourself do what you don’t want?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, all the time.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_55"></a>“Is it hard to listen to your no?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t trust anything I say.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s not true. You trust your reasons for submitting, but not your no. You distrust yourself and try to trust me instead.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, that’s true.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t listen to your no. That’s important because a no to me can be a yes to you. You say yes to others but no to yourself.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But in therapy you would only get better at submitting. The therapy would make you worse!”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s why I told my wife I didn’t want therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You shouldn’t submit to therapy because that would be slavery, not therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Funny you say that. I was a slave in my last job, and I have said no ever since.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I doubt you said no to work but to the slavery you imagined work would be. Since you submitted, you didn’t know how to avoid turning work into slavery, like here.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Would you like me to help you stop submitting and saying yes to what you don’t want?”</p>
<p class="indent">If we cannot say no to others, we cannot say yes to ourselves. We submit to others and blame them for our choice, unaware that we abandon ourselves. To embrace our desires, we must hear our no to others, the inner yes to ourselves, especially when we don’t understand our no.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_56"></a>Psychosyrupy</h3>
<p class="noindent">Not only patients but also therapists can refuse to embrace the facts. Years ago at the Washington School of Psychiatry, a wonderful colleague, Morris Parloff, suffered from an allergy, not to pollen but to misplaced empathy. Suppose a man describes a phone call in which he didn’t listen to his wife and mocked her as “ridiculous” until she slammed down the phone. When the man rages because she hung up on him, the therapist says, “That must have been hard for you.” Morris called this kind of response “psychosyrupy,” a form of pseudoempathy.</p>
<p class="indent">As therapists or friends, we should empathize with the person, not the behaviors that destroy his life. If we support how he dismisses his wife, we collude with his blaming and denial and help him damage his marriage. He will not see how he rejects and <em>creates</em> the wife who hangs up the phone. Pseudoempathy for the defenses encourages self-destruction rather than empathizes with the man who is destroying his marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">He may think we are empathic if we agree with his victim stance, but, in fact, we perpetuate his suffering. If we care for him, we are honest even when he becomes angry, for then he knows we back him, not his self-sabotage.</p>
<p class="indent">When we are honest, he may say, “You’re not listening to me!” In response, we say, in effect, “No, I am listening to you, not to your lie. When you ignore how you dismiss and blow off your wife, you are lying to yourself. If I listen to your lie, I would not be listening to you. I’d be abandoning you. I know this hurts, but I wouldn’t say this to you unless I knew you could face it.” We don’t converse with the lie but with the person hidden underneath it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_57"></a>Saying the truth frees him from his lie. If we empathize with his lie, we leave him trapped within it. When I described to a businessman how he was destroying his marriage, he became angry with me and claimed, “You are attacking me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m not attacking you. I’m describing your behavior. Did I attack you, or does blaming and dismissing your wife attack you and your marriage?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I thought you cared, but you don’t.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Should I support you or the destructive habit killing your relationship? Do I have your permission to point out when you hurt yourself, or do you want me to sit silently, watching you destroy your marriage?”</p>
<p class="indent">He threatened to leave unless I abandoned him: “If you keep talking about this, I’ll quit!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Okay. I can’t stop you from quitting if you don’t want to hear what I say. If what I say is not true, you should leave. If it is true, it will stay true whether you leave or not because the truth is always with us and cannot be left. I could lie to you like others do, but is that really the relationship you want? Why deprive yourself of the healing you longed for?”</p>
<p class="indent">From our depths we long for honesty even if we ask for a lie. Psychosyrupy covers lies with pseudoempathy; psychotherapy uncovers what is under the lies. Knowledge is the food of the soul;<a id="ch3notes-1"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes1"><sup>1</sup></a> lies are the poison. Whether in therapy or in our closest relationships, our lies heal no one, no matter how much syrup we pour on top. When others tell us the truth, they remind us of who we are, whom we had forgotten, and whom we want to find.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_58"></a>Return of the Rejected Self</h3>
<p class="noindent">We also avoid facing ourselves by attributing the truths of our lives to other people. We attribute our desires to them and wait for them to act on these wishes, which we deny as our own. For instance, a man entered his therapy session saying, “I don’t know what to work on.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Okay,” I replied. I waited.</p>
<p class="indent">Fidgeting in his chair, he blurted out, “What do you think I should work on?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But you must have an idea.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="indent">“You came, right?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“And obviously you wouldn’t come here for no reason.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, but I don’t know what to work on.”</p>
<p class="indent">“So a man without a psychological problem comes to a psychotherapist’s office.”</p>
<p class="indent">He squirmed in his chair, sighed, and admitted, “Well, my wife wants a divorce. I suppose you think I should look at that.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Only you can know if you should look at your divorce.”</p>
<p class="indent">With a heavy sigh, he said, “If I don’t, she’ll leave, and I don’t want that.”</p>
<p class="indent">Until we perceive the desires in our hearts, we see them in the hearts of others. This man did not relate to me. He interacted with his wish, which he relocated in me. Then he opposed or distanced himself from <em>my</em> wish for his therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">As long as he warded off his feelings by wishing them away into me, he could never feel, face, or see what was in himself. Since he <a id="page_59"></a>thought that <em>I</em> wanted him to work in therapy, he could not see what <em>he</em> wanted to work on. Rather than face the desire within himself, he examined the one he imagined in me.</p>
<p class="indent">For a while, this strategy works: other people appear to have our feelings and desires. Then life happens. A loved one leaves us, a boss criticizes our work, or a child gives us a dose of snark, and the feelings we reject rush back in with a vengeance. Why?</p>
<p class="indent">The feelings we reject travel temporarily to other people <em>but only in our imagination</em>. In fact, they live within ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">We can project our inner life onto other people or onto objects. For instance, one man saw eyes in the bushes and trees gazing upon him wherever he walked. The hallucinated eyes satisfied his wish to be seen and known by a remote mother who abandoned him during his first year of life. So much longing and heartbreak was located in the branches above him.</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever we reject our feelings, we send them away through projection, asking them to live in other people. When life happens or we are near those we project upon, we feel the feelings we believed were in those people. It’s as if our feelings migrate home after living in other humans.</p>
<p class="indent">The man who said he didn’t know what to work on was anxious. He wondered what I wanted from him, never realizing that he was reacting to his desire, which <em>he imagined</em> was in me. My presence roused his disavowed wish within himself. He thought I <em>made</em> him feel when my presence <em>triggered</em> his feelings and desires, the missing pieces, that were trying to make him whole again.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, no one can return our feelings to us since those feelings never leave; their “travel” is only in our imagination. After we stop fantasizing about imaginary feelings and desires in people, <a id="page_60"></a>we accept the feelings that we believed were outside but that were actually inside, within ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Life triggers our disavowed feelings, and anxiety is its messenger. Anxiety is the sound of those feelings knocking on our heart’s door: a sad child, an angry kid, or a hopeless one asking, “Can I come in? Will you love me?”</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, we reject the feelings arising within and send them to another person. Perhaps it’s a spouse, a child, a friend, or a boss, but we must find somebody to be angry, limited, selfish, or critical: we don’t want to recognize those qualities within ourselves. Having banished our feelings into other people, we distance ourselves from them, analyze them, judge them, and even punish them.</p>
<p class="indent">How do we identify the qualities we deny in ourselves and attribute to others? Our judgments, complaints, and habitual beliefs about people are the mirrors in which we can look to see ourselves. The traits we judge in others we reject within ourselves. We complain that others hurt us to avoid facing how we hurt ourselves. We ignore within ourselves what we focus on in others.</p>
<p class="indent">What if we get married so we can blame spouses for our problems? A married man invited me to conduct a telepathic therapy with his absent wife: “My wife has a problem with intimacy,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“Do you notice you invite me to relate to her problems instead of yours?”</p>
<p class="indent">“She has issues.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That may be, but do you notice you invite me to pay attention to her and not you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“When you invite me to pay attention to her, you ask me to ignore you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh, I didn’t mean to do that.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_61"></a>“That’s important. When you invite me to ignore you, we have a problem with intimacy between you and me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Examining our complaints gives us the chance to see where the blame belongs: in us. Rather than admit what we have done, however, and study our complaints to discover our inner life, we project our problems onto others. Then we lose sight of what’s inside us by imagining what’s inside them.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapist helps our warded-off feelings return home or, more accurately, helps us face the feelings that never left home because they always lived in us. Projections we thought were “not us” were ours all along. We reject our feelings, desires, and urges and imagine we can send them away to live in other people. What if our feelings, longings, and impulses were never bad? Our feelings reach out to give us the information we need.</p>
<p class="indent">By rejecting our feelings, we reject ourselves. We project those feelings onto other people. <em>They</em> are angry; <em>they</em> are selfish; <em>they</em> are critical. And we stay away from them or try to control them, never realizing we are trying to control the emotions we pretend are in them.</p>
<p class="indent">The destructiveness we see in others is in us. They do not need to be fixed. We should love them rather than try to fix them; doing so will also fix what’s inside us.</p>
<p class="indent">Our spouses and others and life itself trigger the feelings we try to avoid within ourselves. We deny those feelings and urges, sending them away, but no matter how far we throw away our feelings, they keep coming back. When we say, “He makes me feel . . . ,” we mean, “He reminds me of what I tried to get rid of in myself.”</p>
<p class="indent">Outside the window, tree branches, a blue sky, flowers, and clouds appear. The universe accepts everything. Likewise, everything human is within us: thoughts, feelings, and urges. We try <a id="page_62"></a>through imagination to send what is inside outside. Then we sense a longing, a longing for what we refused to embrace: the abandoned parts of ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Can we open our hearts to other people, the abandonarium<a id="ch3notes-2"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes2"><sup>2</sup></a> of our rejected feelings, and let the feelings come home, where they have always resided, inside us? When we do, we experience the space we are, the space that holds our inner life.</p>
<h3 class="h3">What Can I Do When I Can Do Nothing?</h3>
<p class="noindent">What better place to put our feelings than in our family members? Where else should we make impossible demands? And why pick anywhere else to fight, when we have so much practice doing it there? Often, “family” conflicts are conflicts with reality.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, a woman we discussed earlier had a conflict with her fifty-year-old son. The father had sexually abused the son as a child. As soon as the mother found out, she sought help, arranging therapy for her son and the family. Sadly, the son did not benefit from therapy; instead, he developed and then nurtured a conviction that his mother had destroyed his life and, further, that she should support him financially, a belief he had bullied her with for thirty years. “My suffering is your fault, and if you don’t support me, I’ll kill myself,” he said. The mother was vulnerable to this threat because she not only felt guilty for the son’s abuse but for her sister’s suicide in her youth.</p>
<p class="indent">“He said if I don’t pay, he’ll report me to the licensing board, and I’ll lose my ability to practice law.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Which would not work,” I said. “He threatens you, as if you should pay for eternity.” She cried, “I failed him.” I agreed, “Yes, you failed him for a period in childhood, and then you did what <a id="page_63"></a>you could to the best of your ability. Right?” She recounted how she arranged therapy, admitted her mistakes to him, arranged special tutoring, and put him through college until he dropped out. “He says that his father’s abuse destroyed his life and it’s my fault.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Your ex-husband’s abuse traumatized your son. And the way the two of you handled things created problems. That is your responsibility, but for the past thirty years he has made his mistakes, created his misery, and sabotaged his ambitions, career, and marriages. You didn’t do that. He did. You are responsible for whatever mess you created until he was twenty, but he is responsible for the messes he created the past thirty years and the messes he creates today.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I thought if I paid for private schools for the grandkids that he would help them, but he lets them skip school, not do homework, and watch television.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You thought you could buy their future, but he threw their future and your money down the toilet.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I feel like I have to defend myself.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. You are trying to defend a self-image. You loved this image of the perfect mother and gave money to your son, hoping he would restore it, but this wish is a secret vampire that sucks the life out of you. Once you drop this image, what is there to defend? You failed him once as a child. Okay. No need to defend that. It’s true. He must make his life; you can’t do it for him. That’s true. Your actions in the past make it harder for him today.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He says I’m trying to buy his forgiveness.”</p>
<p class="indent">“And after two hundred thousand dollars over thirty years the evidence is in. You wished your payoffs would buy his forgiveness. They didn’t. He discovered that refusing to forgive you pays very well.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_64"></a>She burst into laughter, paused, and said, “I tried to tell him he is ruining his children but he doesn’t listen. He either screams at me on the phone or hangs up. I know he’ll call back because he needs money. He has to face reality.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No he doesn’t. He hasn’t faced reality for thirty years: he was fired from every job, ruined every relationship, and has been unemployed, refusing to look for work, claiming you should support him in the lifestyle he has become accustomed to. It looks like you have been nominated to be the person who looks at reality.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That is true.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I can understand that you wish he would face the facts first, but that makes you the hostage of his craziness.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I can’t wait any longer. I can’t afford it, but what if he gets enraged with me?”</p>
<p class="indent">“He won’t be enraged with you. He is enraged with the facts of life. Once you stop putting your money between him and the facts, he can be enraged with reality as a first step in engaging and facing it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Our loved ones can make terrible choices, and we can’t always stop them. Rather than bear the grief inside us, we try to change them to make our pain go away. When we try to change them by sharing insights with them, we provoke rage at worst or perplexity at best. We think we are putting out their fire when we are trying to put out our own, the fire of pain, rage, and loss. We never extinguish a fire in ourselves by pouring our fire on others. The kindest gift we can offer our loved ones is to own our projections and follow the advice we keep giving them.</p>
<p class="indent">It is hard to sit in our feelings, so we export them onto others. We try to coerce people into being who we want them to be through <a id="page_65"></a>explanations, instructions, or demands. The latent message remains the same: “My perception should be your reality!”</p>
<p class="indent">Wilting under our wants, people may do what we desire, making us happy when they cave in to our demands. When they don’t, we judge them, tell them they are wrong, and, without their consent, appoint ourselves as their much-needed advisors. Then we are surprised when they are less than delighted by our guidance.</p>
<p class="indent">They react with rage because we reject them the way they are. We treat them like home renovation projects in constant need of improvement. We give them the message, “You are <em>almost</em> good enough for me, but first you need to change.”</p>
<p class="indent">Other people are not here to become lovable to us, to reject themselves the way we reject them. We are here to love them the way they are, to surrender to what is true: they should be who they are, not how we want them to be. And that surrender might mean that we have to love ourselves when they can’t. Then we set limits. This doesn’t mean we ask them to change their behavior, which we can’t control. We change our behavior, no longer rewarding them when they harm us or our relationship. We face reality while loving them, no longer collaborating with their destructiveness.</p>
<p class="indent">This is easier said than done, especially when our hopes are burning in a fire our loved ones set, blow on, and maintain, even if they blame us for setting it and ask us to put it out. The mother had to accept that her son was an arsonist who set his own life on fire, and neither her love nor money would put out his fires when he kept setting new ones.</p>
<p class="indent">When loved ones disappoint us, we can let go of the image they didn’t live up to, bear our feelings, and allow life to be revealed as a mysterious gift. Or we can ward off our feelings, cling to our <a id="page_66"></a>illusions, rebuff the relationship we have, try to buy the one we want, and call these actions “love.”</p>
<p class="indent">What if the mother’s disappointment in her son is not a problem but an opportunity? Continual disappointments do not reflect upon others but upon us; they reflect our resistance to what is happening. If you disappoint me once, that is information about you. If you disappoint me dozens of times, that is information about me: my denial of reality. We can’t be repeatedly disappointed unless we keep denying what is true, only to be surprised by its return. By disappointing our wishes, people help us see what is here.</p>
<p class="indent">When we embrace our disappointments rather than deny them, we can grieve, letting go of our hopes and fantasies of a family renovation project. To face what is, we must bury our illusions in the boneyard. The mother did not die that day in my office. Her hopeless hopes did. We performed the last rites for the son who used to love her.</p>
<p class="indent">She fantasized that money could purchase her son’s love and health, but she could not buy back the life he threw away. Through his actions, he sent her a perverse love note: “Give up. <em>Your</em> love cannot stop <em>my</em> self-destruction.” Constant disappointments crucified her fantasies on the cross of reality.</p>
<p class="indent">When she said, “I can’t take it!” I reminded her, “You already did. You’ve taken it for thirty years, but your denial can’t take it, and it is breaking under the strain.” We think we are in charge of what is happening, but life is in charge, and it dissolves the fairy tale of existence being our way instead of the way it is.</p>
<p class="indent">We try to push life up to the mountaintop of fantasy, but life rushes back down to the lower world of reality. Life teaches us, and one of its finest instructors is our family. Remember the story of the three little pigs that lived in houses of straw, sticks, and bricks? <a id="page_67"></a>Whatever is happening challenges the house of <em>thoughts</em> we live in. Devoted to our growth, our family reminds us of what is. Life continues to huff and puff, and we keep clinging to the walls of wishing that already blew down.</p>
<p class="indent">When we stop clinging to our fantasies, we can begin to accept and love the family we have, and discover the mystery they are, people whom we thought we knew but really are only coming to know. And even if our family is rotten or evil, loving means we will not deny the truth, and we will let their evil teach us what we need to learn.</p>
<p class="indent">When the mother let go of the son she wanted, she started loving the son she had. No longer able to bully his mother, her son had to face the fact that he had no choice but to have a better relationship with her. Why? She no longer joined him in his old destructive dance.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Pushing or Embracing?</h3>
<p class="noindent">When death blows down our dreams, how do we listen? A therapist told me about a woman dying of cancer. The patient’s surgeon nicked a tumor while removing it, spreading cancer cells throughout the patient’s body and leaving her with a fatal prognosis. The therapist told her supervisor, “I’m afraid pushing her for her feelings will be too much for her.” Her supervisor agreed, “This is a deep intuitive truth.” The supervisor’s support left the therapist feeling validated yet troubled, so she raised the question with me: “Do you think her feelings will be too much for her?”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s not possible to push her,” I said. “Cancer and death did that. Have you noticed how cancer and death never knock on the door to ask if they’re too much for us? Life comes whether we are ready or not, but it’s not that we aren’t ready: our illusions aren’t.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_68"></a>“How do I know whether she can take it?” she asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“She already took cancer and death.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I see what you mean.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s not too much for her. She is still here.” I paused. “Is it too much for you?” I waited. She looked at the floor.</p>
<p class="indent">“She is dying. You can’t save her. She is enraged with a doctor whose failure killed her. She is losing the life she hoped for—the chance to grow old, to see her children become adults. Will you hold her hand, face her death, and bear these feelings with her?”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s painful.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s true.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You are challenging me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. Life did that. In fact, life is not challenging you. Life is challenging an image of therapy. You thought your supervisor validated you, but she validated an image of therapy and life with sunlight but no darkness, skies but no clouds, and possession but no loss.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I felt she supported me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“She supported your wish to run. And all of us want to run from death rather than learn from it. I’m a great runner from life myself, but if you wanted to abandon her, you wouldn’t have brought this up. Because you know this, you won’t let go of her hand when she’s in her deepest need.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s painful to watch her die, and I can’t do anything.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You can’t make her pain go away. You can’t give her life, but by acknowledging her pain, loss, and death, you make it more bearable because the two of you are facing it together.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That wasn’t the job description at social services.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Therapy isn’t a job, an occupation, or a profession. It’s a calling. Her cancer, her dying, and her suffering are calling out to you. <a id="page_69"></a>Now you must answer her call, listen to the hand by your side that wants to reach out to hers, and sit beside her while she dies.”</p>
<p class="indent">“This is so uncomfortable!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course. We feel pain too as our dreams for her and the therapy burn up. We can’t save her. Everything goes up in flames, but eventually the fire dies down, and in the ashes, you and she will discover what is left, something you can’t know yet, put into words, or describe. She’ll discover who she is under the words, dreams, and illusions, and so will you.”</p>
<p class="indent">We try to push life and death out of ourselves, but they continually embrace us, pushing out the lies. As friends, healers, or therapists, we must embrace death as well—the death of our relationships, our hopes, and our dreams. As we sit with a dying person, we realize we are dying too. By embracing what is, both of us learn who we are under the words in the quiet stillness.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Psychological Cherry-Picking</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rather than face what is, we pick the parts of life that fit our fantasy, reject the rest, and try to live outside reality. We think we are running from the outer world, but we are running from what the outer world evokes: the inner world—our feelings and anxiety. And we never escape from who we are.</p>
<p class="indent">The feelings that choose us guide us. Through grief, we face loss and feel love for those who died. When people ignore our boundaries, anger helps us defend ourselves. Fear is not a danger but a signal, alerting us to dangers, internal or external. Thus, feelings are positive, promoting our survival.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, then, do we judge feelings as negative? We reject them: “I don’t want to feel this way.” As psychological cherry pickers, we call <a id="page_70"></a>feelings we want “positive” and feelings we don’t want “negative.” We try to split the world in two, hoping to live in one half and leave the other. We think we should be all good, but we keep being how we are: good and bad.</p>
<p class="indent">Since bearing all we feel within ourselves is painful, we try to avoid one half of ourselves. A man who meditated for decades avoided his anger, believing it thwarted his spiritual growth. He claimed, “Anger is unspiritual. Whatever you pay attention to grows, so you should never be angry.” He used meditation techniques to zone out, trying to purify himself of unspiritual feelings. However, skirting his anger turned him into an exploding doormat who appeared passive until he threw tantrums at work.</p>
<p class="indent">The psychologist John Welwood has called rage avoidance “spiritual bypassing.”<a id="ch3notes-3"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes3"><sup>3</sup></a> We can, and often do, misuse spirituality to sidestep feelings, conflicts, and life. Longing for states of detachment—mislabeled as transcendence—we achieve a form of spiritual divorce. This man tried to transcend his inner life by rejecting it and burying his emotions, not realizing he had planted a seed that would grow from within.</p>
<p class="indent">He treated experiences he didn’t want as nonspiritual garbage. Yet just as the air cannot leave the wind, we cannot leave who we are. Feelings and thoughts arise within us <em>and always will</em>. We never escape who we are because we are neither an object nor a location.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than bear our inner life, we try to slice it off. This is not therapy or spiritual practice but psychic self-amputation. As the philosopher Simone Weil reminds us, “Life does not need to mutilate itself to be pure.”<a id="ch3notes-4"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet people mutilate themselves, mistaking a body part for a hated part of their humanity; they hope to recover their purity through self-cutting.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_71"></a>The very idea of purity divorces us from what is true because life includes purity <em>and</em> impurity. By trying to purify himself spiritually, this man attempted to separate himself from his feelings and life to live in an alternate world where anger did not exist.</p>
<p class="indent">His self-image, how he thought he <em>ought</em> to be, contradicted the facts: who he was. We push ourselves to become the idealized picture we cherish. This never works because we are reality. The picture of what we <em>should</em> be is fantasy.</p>
<p class="indent">If we give up the violence of self-purification, does awareness ever have a problem with whatever arises? Does a mirror reject whatever appears?</p>
<p class="indent">Life is not a supermarket where we shop for feelings to put in the cart and leave the discards on the shelf. Why split life in half and discard the rest? In therapy we embrace everything and in the end, we don’t even need to embrace our being since we have always been what we are.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Hunting</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rather than embrace life and ourselves, we engage in cherry-picking or its opposite. One man seized on the most negative facts of his life, turning them over in his mind repeatedly until he suffered from chronic rumination. Obsessed with the worst, he could not see how he created a partial view of the universe or that his negative view, not the universe, caused his suffering. He mistook his rumination, a cherished habit, for a higher form of thought. To counter this, I noted that when we see dog feces on the sidewalk, we manage to walk by rather than pick it up, sniff it, and put it in our pocket. Startled, he stared at me and asked, “Oh, you mean I’m a turd hunter?”</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_72"></a>I Have No Blind Spots!</h3>
<p class="noindent">When no longer searching for turds, we hunt for a better truth elsewhere rather than face the truth that is always here. Why don’t we see it? We have blind spots. And since we always have blind spots, we always need others to help us see what we don’t see. For instance, one fellow claimed, “You wouldn’t believe how humble I’ve become!”</p>
<p class="indent">Therapy doesn’t eliminate blind spots. It helps us accept our never-ending blindness, so we can welcome feedback from those who see what we cannot. Terrified of our fear, we avoid feedback through illusions and defenses and become blind to the world outside them.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet blindness is not only a matter of what we don’t see but also what we want others not to see. Rather than endure the darkness alone, we ask others to join us, to blind themselves by denying what is happening the way we do. Then we can delight in the bliss of mutual blindness: our agreement not to see what we don’t want to see. This never works, for facts do not stop existing when we deny their existence. Through denial, we create our suffering, not seeing how we do it.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, a woman proudly informed me that she had “asserted” herself by calling her husband an asshole.</p>
<p class="indent">“You shouldn’t call your husband an asshole.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why not? I’m just being honest.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What you call honesty, others would call cruelty. Remember that phrase: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me’? I don’t believe that. Words hurt, and I suspect you hurt him when you called him an asshole.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He needs to hear the truth.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_73"></a>“I’m sure he did, for the fact is that you called him a name—asshole. You didn’t care what he felt. And he will remember the truth: you don’t care.”</p>
<p class="indent">She believed she had insight into her husband but was blind to the impact of her words, their meaning, and her cruelty. By arguing, she tried to convince me to join her denial and blindness. When I pointed out that he would experience her as cruel and noncaring, she said, “I didn’t mean it that way. He shouldn’t take it personally,” as if meaning could be severed from speech and consequences removed from words. Alas, her contempt did have a consequence: a divorce.</p>
<p class="indent">We enter therapy not knowing what causes our problems. We start by saying, “I don’t get it. I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, but it’s not working.” We have theories to explain our suffering, but those theories, like, “he’s an asshole,” turn out to be forms of blindness, and because we cherish those theories, we ask others to agree: “Don’t you think he was wrong?”</p>
<p class="indent">If our therapists and friends love us, they will not love the lie that blinds us but reveal the truth it hides. If we love them, we suffer the truth they offer and live it. If we love our lie, however, we retaliate by criticizing, trying to push our pain into them: “That’s not true! That’s what <em>you</em> do!”</p>
<p class="indent">Since all of us have blind spots, we need others to point them out. And when they help us see what we don’t see, we can do what we could not do before: embrace reality and receive its gifts. Until then we will be blind. Why? We blind ourselves with the lies we tell ourselves.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_74"></a>I Am Another You and Also Not You</h3>
<p class="noindent">Our psychological blindness results from the ways we blind ourselves through defenses. Nothing human is alien to us.<a id="ch3notes-5"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yet every defense claims that feelings, thoughts, or desires are alien. We judge people for avoiding their pain through lying, ignoring the fact that we do the same. Or we pretend not to have specific emotions, urges, or problems. The psychiatrist Harry Stack Sullivan reminds us that “we are much more human than otherwise.”<a id="ch3notes-6"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes6"><sup>6</sup></a> Each of us suffers the slings and arrows of life, loss, and death and tries to avoid what is.</p>
<p class="indent">We deny the humanity in ourselves that we judge in others. For instance, we might say, “The president is arrogant,” “Wealthy people are greedy,” or “Poor people are lazy.” Each of us can be arrogant, greedy, and lazy but we are more comfortable when we imagine that a human trait is not in ourselves but in others we judge. But it’s not true.</p>
<p class="indent">Fellow stumblers, deniers, and liars, all of us make mistakes and cause pain to others. These facts are painful to face. Instead, we try to step out of the world of humanity through our powers of imagination and pretend to be superior beings, watching <em>those</em> people, judging <em>them</em>, and rejecting <em>their</em> humanity. Without realizing it, we are judging our own humanity.</p>
<p class="indent">Every defense tries to kill our inner life or outer life. Each time we say our grief is silly, our desires are ridiculous, or our anger is ugly, we commit a murder. We can die of a single cut to the wrists or a thousand cuts to the soul, a psychological suicide.</p>
<p class="indent">When we meet a person, we find a different heart, a different mind, and a different part of life, which blows down our house of fantasies. In response, we can let go and accommodate life. Or <a id="page_75"></a>rather than accept a different mind, we may dismiss it, showing contempt, or even entertain the most dangerous fantasy: “If I kill him, I can kill what he thinks.” Every week fanatics try to kill thoughts and feelings by killing people instead.</p>
<p class="indent">These killings may be real or symbolic: whether it’s the sarcastic attack of a pundit on a talk show, the wife who screams at her husband, or the father who beats his son, each attack tries to annihilate another person, another opinion, or another part of life. Yet just as we are powerless to stop death, we are powerless to stop life.</p>
<p class="indent">The Roman theologian Tertullian lamented two thousand years ago that “the first reaction to the truth is hatred.”<a id="ch3notes-7"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes7"><sup>7</sup></a> Hatred tries to make reality disappear, and its constant failure to do so accounts for its violence; hatred always rises as if it only needed to become larger than life to overcome it. Fanatics, killers, and bullies believe they can eradicate an attitude even though the capacity for thought is born again in each child.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet in each generation too many children grow up in homes where they must silence their minds. The patient who suffered from psychological tyranny as a child may bring into therapy her childhood of soul murder:<a id="ch3notes-8"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes8"><sup>8</sup></a> “Will this therapist ask me to surrender my desire? Will I demand that the therapist surrender her opinions to prove she loves me? Can my mind and the therapist’s mind coexist?” Often this conflict occurs in therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">A forty-year-old man consulted me due to problems in his relationships, problems he enacted with me. After I pointed out how his distancing behaviors with me reflected his distant relationships with women, he snapped, “This is a bunch of crap!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Do you notice how you are becoming sarcastic with me?”</p>
<p class="indent">“So what! I don’t believe a word you are saying.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_76"></a>“It’s okay with me that you disagree with me. Is it okay with you if I disagree with you?”</p>
<p class="indent">He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Sure.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Obviously we have two points of view. You have yours and I have mine, and that’s as it should be. Two minds in the same room. I assume that’s okay with you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If it’s okay with you that we disagree, why do the extra work of sarcasm since it’s not necessary?”</p>
<p class="indent">Surprised, he said, “I don’t know. I never thought about it.”</p>
<p class="indent">A few seconds later, he spontaneously described his alcoholic father, a tyrannical, sarcastic, and abusive man who had beaten him. Having been verbally abused by his father, he verbally abused me. His abusive speech, the apparent barrier, was the window to his past suffering. Rather than tell me his history through words, he presented his past through actions.</p>
<p class="indent">Bullies browbeat, abusive fathers batter, and fanatics kill, but they never eradicate reality. This man grew up to abuse himself and his loved ones while fearing they would abuse him. As an adult he became an abuser and the abused, perpetuating the pain he suffered as a child.</p>
<p class="indent">No matter how much he dismissed himself and me, his inner life always existed, even if it was hidden within his symptom of dismissal. Ever faithful, his anxiety kept pointing to the inner life waiting for his attention. In this sense, no one comes to therapy—our anxiety and symptoms bring us, hoping for the embrace that heals.</p>
<p class="indent">We want to get rid of the inner life that lugs us into therapy. Yet our task is to accept and bear how we are. As human beings, I am you, and you are me; we embrace each other as people who <a id="page_77"></a>stumble, deny, and project. What if we are saved by embracing what we reject in ourselves and attribute to others? When this man saw that I was not his abuser, he realized that he had abused himself and others. As a result, he began to grieve over his losses and faced the rage he felt toward his father. Embracing his inner life, he stopped the abuse and dared to love once again.</p>
<p class="indent">People reveal to us other minds, thoughts, and beliefs—ours are not the only ones. Our image of the world doesn’t contain their world, and our image of ourselves doesn’t contain what they see. Our certainty disappears when we realize that our ideas about others describe our beliefs, not their being. The living person cannot be contained in a frozen idea. The man who claimed that what I offered was garbage saw his opinion, not me. He forgot that our reactions and ideas point to what is larger.</p>
<p class="indent">When we recognize that the idea of other people as separate and pathological is merely an image, our imaginary separation from the human ends. Until then, we suffer the alienation and loneliness that plagues our lives when we regard others as “not me.”</p>
<h3 class="h3">Can I Pay You to Lie to Me?</h3>
<p class="noindent">To embrace other people, we must face their lies and our own. What if we are asked to lie? A man claimed he didn’t need therapy. Since his friends thought he had a drug problem, he asked me to take his money so he could tell them he was in treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">It was a test: Would I offer a lie therapy or a real therapy?</p>
<p class="indent">He explained, “I just want to get my friends off my back.”</p>
<p class="indent">“They aren’t on your back. The truth is. And they keep pointing it out.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If I don’t hear it from them though, I can forget it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_78"></a>“You can forget the truth. It doesn’t need you to remember it for it to exist. No matter how far you run, there you are.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Look. I’ll show up and pay you. Then I can tell them I’m in therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But you won’t be. You’ll be in a pretend therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“They won’t know.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But we will. You ask me to offer a lie therapy we know would not be real. You hope that by buying dishonesty from me, you can buy reality, but it is not for sale.”</p>
<p class="indent">He smirked, “I won’t tell anyone. You would be helping me out.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’d be helping your lie, not you. If I sell my integrity to you, I’ll be a useless liar, another fraud in your life.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ve seen therapists and done rehab before, and they’ve been happy to take my money.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If I take your money for what you ask, I would be corrupt, not worthy of your trust. You would have no reason to trust me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Are you saying I should see someone one else?”</p>
<p class="indent">“You can find people who will help you lie if you try hard enough, but why hire a liar for a therapist?”</p>
<p class="indent">In therapy and life we meet with liars. We must be honest with ourselves that they are lying, and if we help them lie, we are lying to ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">We hope to be healed, yet we fear what could heal us: saying, feeling, and facing the truth. Every one of us lies, and we will not drop our defenses just because a therapist points one out. We let go of them when the therapist is honest and neither colludes with our lies nor disregards our defenses. In a healing relationship we both must be honest.</p>
<p class="indent">We don’t ask a liar to be honest. That is our lie, our resistance to facing his lies. The liar asks us to lie to find out if we are <a id="page_79"></a>trustworthy. And when he lies, we must notice the urgency in his voice or in our hearts, for disappearing beneath the lies, the cries of his former potential become increasingly muffled and finally mute.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Devaluation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another lie we tell is devaluation. One woman claimed I was useless, my comments were ridiculous, and the therapy was worthless. She devalued me, her close friends, and her family, alienating them and punishing herself with a lifetime of loneliness.</p>
<p class="indent">All of us will be devalued. It’s nothing personal about us; it’s something impersonal about the defenses devaluers use. It’s not the hydrant’s fault when the dog lifts his leg, nor is it our fault when people devalue us. People claim we have no value to avoid depending on the value we offer. Through devaluation they ward off the danger of depending upon others. Or people may deny our value to achieve an imaginary victory when they envy our genuine success. Unable to tolerate their envy, they devalue in us what they cannot find within themselves.<a id="ch3notes-9"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">When this woman claimed the therapy was useless, I asked, “Do you notice how you are devaluing me?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Are you saying I have to value you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. You can devalue me. It’s a free country. But as long as you devalue me, you will relate to a worthless therapist and end up with a worthless therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent">“This therapy is worthless.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m glad we are in agreement. As long as you devalue me, this therapy will be worthless.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m not getting anything out of this therapy.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_80"></a>“Of course. If you devalue me, you won’t depend upon me, and you won’t get anything out of the therapy. You can keep devaluing me if that works for you, but the therapy will end in failure.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why shouldn’t I devalue you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m your therapist, not your toilet.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What if your therapy is worthless?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Is the therapy worthless or is your devaluation? You can devalue me. I can’t stop you, but then this will become another failed therapy in the graveyard of failed therapies, and we will have to hold the funeral for the life you could have had. Why sabotage your therapy? Why perpetuate your suffering?”</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever we invite anyone to form a close relationship with us, our invitation will stir up memories of past relationships. In this woman’s past, the ones she loved had hurt her. My offer of help stirred up mixed feelings: she wanted my actual care and feared my imagined cruelty.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than risk being devalued as she was in the past, she devalued people in the present. She enacted her past: “Since you will abandon and devalue me if I depend on you, I will devalue you first.”</p>
<p class="indent">When people devalue us, we may feel angry, as they felt when others devalued them. If we do not recognize this anger, we may turn it on ourselves: “Maybe she’s right: I am not good enough.” Or, intimidated by her, we might submit to devaluation as the patient submitted to her mother: “Since she gets angry when I talk, maybe she will like me if I stay quiet.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sigmund Freud called the process of understanding and interpreting these dynamics “working through.”<a id="ch3notes-10"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes10"><sup>10</sup></a> But recognizing the intense emotions that get stirred up in this process, the interpersonal analysts suggested we call it “living through.”<a id="ch3notes-11"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes11"><sup>11</sup></a> In <a id="page_81"></a>relationships, we face intense feelings and learn through living. That means we must face devaluation whenever it occurs, whether with a boss, a colleague, or a spouse.</p>
<p class="indent">When people devalue us, we might confuse our response of silence with kindness, but accepting devaluation is masochistic submission. The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas once said we should never submit to another person because, in doing so, we invite her to sin.<a id="ch3notes-12"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes12"><sup>12</sup></a> Continuing to devalue hurts her, and when we accept devaluation, our resulting anger, depression, and despair hurt us. Submitting and retaliating do not help. What should we do? Tell the truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Devaluations are not insights but mind droppings. We are not useless; her devaluation is. Ironically, devaluation <em>reveals</em> our worth—what the devaluer envies and cannot tolerate receiving from us. Devaluation starves a person of any healthy human connection. It tries to kill off anything good that triggers envy.</p>
<p class="indent">To stop the murder of any relationship, not only therapy, we respond to hatred with strength.<a id="ch3notes-13"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes13"><sup>13</sup></a> A person can devalue us if she wants, but we have a choice too: we can part ways rather than collaborate with the cancer of her life. When we no longer defer to her devaluation, she gains a friend, or in this case, a therapist she cannot destroy but can depend on.</p>
<p class="indent">When people devalue us, we set limits to keep our relationship from becoming a latrine.<a id="ch3notes-14"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes14"><sup>14</sup></a> If we agree with a person’s devaluation, we encourage her to commit a crime: killing a relationship. We should never submit to devaluation, even though life and therapy involve submission. We submit to the truth, not to a lie, and devaluation is a lie told to us.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_82"></a>We Die Once from Death but a Thousand Times from Self-Doubt</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes people devalue us. More often we devalue ourselves. One woman said to me, “I always find fault with myself. I doubt myself all day long.” Her self-doubt was self-hatred masquerading as “higher thought.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I want to go to this workshop, but I am not smart enough.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Could this be a self-critical thought?”</p>
<p class="indent">“What if I don’t have what it takes?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Could this be self-doubt?”</p>
<p class="indent">“What if I fail?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Can we live tomorrow today?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Notice how you misuse this fantasy of the future to torture yourself today? It’s as if you are saying, ‘Why suffer then when I could suffer now?’”</p>
<p class="indent">She chuckled. “I do that a lot.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Does this down payment of self-doubt punish you for wanting to leave your boss for a better job?”</p>
<p class="indent">She laughed guiltily.</p>
<p class="indent">When we doubt ourselves, we refuse to sit with our feelings to discover who will emerge. We preworry, filling the future with fears rather than going into the unknown of who we are.</p>
<p class="indent">We go through life with a candle, imagining that the light shows the world when it reveals only a sliver of life. Our true value lies not within the light but in the darkness. Who knows our future? No one. The task is to surrender to and embrace the unknown of ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Letting go of doubt’s certainty, we realize how it blinded us to our true potential. And as we let go of the lie of self-denigration, <a id="page_83"></a>feelings open our eyes so we can live the truth formerly hidden under self-doubt.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Gaslighting</h3>
<p class="noindent">Others blind us by asking us to agree with their lies, and we blind ourselves through false beliefs. Rather than admit that we can never plumb the depths of another person, we claim to know them, and that certainty becomes a new blind spot. To know any person, we start by recognizing that we don’t. Not knowing is the precondition for learning about any person. It allows us to open ourselves to the mystery of another person. What happens, though, if we refuse to open ourselves up to other people?</p>
<p class="indent">A man consulted me regarding his previous therapist: “She told me my blinking eyes meant I felt murderous rage. Is that true?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. That is mind reading, not therapy,” I replied. Not knowing the depths of another person, we live with risk. We must drop our fantasies to relate to him.</p>
<p class="indent">This man continued. “When she told me something negative about myself, and I disagreed, she said this proved I was resisting. If I agreed to an accusation I did not feel was true, I gained her approval. It felt like a Catch-22.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It was,” I replied.</p>
<p class="indent">By interpreting disagreement as resistance, we can try to bully people into submission and call it “collaboration.” Any fact can be misused to convince people that our projection is real. It’s called “gaslighting” after the famous film<a id="ch3notes-15"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes15"><sup>15</sup></a> in which a man conceals and distorts the facts enough to convince his wife that she is going crazy.</p>
<p class="indent">Those who try to dominate and control another person do not help him find his words, they give him theirs—“listening” <a id="page_84"></a>as ventriloquism. Instead of exploring his conflicts, they tell him what to do. When they are uncomfortable, they accuse him of “making” them feel what they don’t want to feel. A therapist said to her supervisor, “This patient puts her confusion into me.” The supervisor replied, “No, my dear. I’m afraid <em>you</em> are confused.”</p>
<p class="indent">We blame others for our feelings without first examining our own. If we don’t examine our feelings, we attribute them to another person. Then we equate that person with our belief: “Your blinking eyes mean you feel murderous rage.” Now we relate not to a person but to an idea in our head.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than push others to fit our ideas, we must become receptive, allowing what is happening to push our ideas to fit what is real. A student asked about her patient, “What will she do next?” I said, “I don’t know. When therapists project what the patient will do, we avoid facing what we don’t know. Our job is to be open to what we don’t expect. If we’re not open, we predict, and prediction is a fancy word for therapist projection.”</p>
<p class="indent">We try to predict the future rather than live into it and discover the mystery of other people. By predicting, we control our anxiety about walking into the unknown. A man met a woman at a bar and asked for her number. Later he called her for a date, but she was distant and didn’t agree to go on a date. When I asked what he felt, he said, “I feel overwhelming desire for her. I know she will love me.” Of course, this was not “knowledge” but his belief. He didn’t love her. He loved how he wanted her to be. He acted as if his desire was so great he could make what is real turn unreal. He kept calling her until she blocked his number. He tried to control her to avoid feeling his anger and grief: “I’ve been rejected.” Controlling her meant he was at war with how she was. When he dropped his idea of how she “should” be, he stopped trying to control her and <a id="page_85"></a>life. He became open to her, loss, and his feelings, embracing life as it was. Before, he thought he could reject the law of loss and rewrite reality. Then he let the loss and rage go through him. Instead of desiring what was not happening, he began to accept what <em>was</em> happening.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of opening ourselves to life, we may fight it. Rather than open herself up to the patient in front of her, one therapist told patients they were “helpless, pitiful, crippled” or “filled with deep pathology.” They became toxic waste dumps for projections masquerading as interpretations.</p>
<p class="indent">When I, with my history of destructiveness, can speak to you as a fellow stumbler, I no longer shine the light on <em>your</em> pathology but on <em>our</em> shared humanity. When we place our problems in others, we try to control our crises there. Meanwhile, we forget that we judge in others what we reject in ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">This man who loved the woman who rejected him believed she should love his wish instead of her wish. He judged her for rejecting him when he rejected her desire. He thought she had not given him a chance. In fact, he had not given her a chance. He needed to accept her rather than love his wish. He had such a good fantasy script for her. He believed she had rejected him when he had rejected her as she was.</p>
<p class="indent">When we no longer ask other people to live up to our ideals, we can be real with them and ourselves and stop fighting life. In gaslighting, we try to change reality or make others not see it so we can live in our wishing well. In life, we embrace how others <em>are</em>, not how we <em>want</em> them to be. Until then, we resist life, thinking that life resists us.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_86"></a>Can My Love Melt His Defenses?</h3>
<p class="noindent">If it did, no one would use defenses anymore. Psychiatrists from Bruno Bettelheim<a id="ch3notes-16"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes16"><sup>16</sup></a> to Aaron Beck<a id="ch3notes-17"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch3notes17"><sup>17</sup></a> have said, “Love is not enough.” Why does this myth persist? It was our childhood strategy: “If I love mom and dad, they will love me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Love is powerful; but the door must be open for love to enter the house. When defenses close the door, no one can enter. The child thinks his parents’ hearts closed because of what he did. Blaming himself, he believes he must become a better boy, even more loving, for their hearts to open.</p>
<p class="indent">We still cherish that wish, hoping that if we are kind, others will be kind; if we are nice, they will be nice; if we love them, they will love us. Can love make facts go away?</p>
<p class="indent">Even in therapy we find this marriage of fantasies. A therapy website asks prospective patients, “What would your life be like if you had a father who knew how to love you and to guide you through different stages of your life? Would your heart be more open to love? Being re-fathered as an adult can be a nourishing experience for under-fathered men and women.” What a lovely fairy tale: a therapist offers me the love my father didn’t offer, and my past losses are magically eliminated.</p>
<p class="indent">Who has not hoped that love in the present could erase pain in the past? We wish love could do magic, and faced with enormous pain, therapists can wish the same. A psychotherapist years ago invited patients to put on diapers, sit in his lap, and suck on a baby bottle. He tried to reparent them to undo parental failures.</p>
<p class="indent">Alas, what is lost is lost. Refathering, remothering, and reparenting are not therapy but magic, attempts to fill the void in the past with fantasies in the present. We can’t make the dead alive. <a id="page_87"></a>We can’t rewind and rerecord the DVD of life. Unable to wipe out the past, we can only create a better present, accepting loss as part of life.</p>
<p class="indent">While we wish we could erase the pain of the past through love, we must face the limitations of life, loss, and death so real healing can occur. Therapy cannot replace what we lost, but it can help us let go of our barriers to love. Then we can mourn what was impossible in the past to form what is possible today.</p>
<p class="indent">It is impossible to melt defenses with love. Love is not water, and defenses are not ice. Trying to melt defenses with love is like trying to light a fire while our partner throws water on it. In this blind love, we don’t see the whole person, only the part we want. Rather than embrace the fact—for example, “he rejects me”—we love the qualities we want and ignore the person we find. This is not a heroic act but hatred of the person. We try to become larger than reality through omnipotence: “I will <em>make</em> you love me while you reject me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Trying to <em>make</em> anyone love us is not love but violence. We try to kill the person we meet and love the one we want. In fact, we don’t love him. We love the <em>fantasy</em> we want him to become.</p>
<p class="indent">We wish our love were enough to heal, but if defenses close the door then love cannot enter. If our hearts are not open, we must open them. But if the doors of others are closed, we must go to other doors, open doors, where love can finally walk in.<a id="page_88"></a></p>
