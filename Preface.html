<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">L</span>ife is hard, but psychological suffering can be unbearable. To find a way to bear it, we may seek a therapist. A good therapist has an innate wisdom born from the pain of life, a wisdom that can be earned no other way. But once we find such a person, how do we work together to stop our suffering?</p>
<p class="indent">To answer this question, we must understand why we suffer and how we return to health. We become ill because of the lies we swallowed and the lies we tell ourselves to avoid pain. Perhaps we swallowed a lie that we are bad rather than recognize that a person wronged us. We might tell ourselves a lie such as “Things will get better” rather than face a crumbling marriage. We become well by facing the truths of our inner life and outer life together. All of us tell ourselves lies to avoid pain: it’s human. The problem? We don’t see the ways we fool ourselves. That’s why we seek a therapist: to help us face what we avoid.</p>
<p class="indent">This book can help you see not only the falsehoods that cause our suffering but how to face the truth to become free. It will help you see what therapy looks like when it leads to change. Therapy is not merely a chat, a checklist review, or the “solving” of you as a crossword puzzle. Therapy is a relationship between two people devoted to facing the deepest truths of our lives so we can be healed.</p>
<p class="indent">We will explore the lies that make us ill so we can embrace the truth that makes us well. In this era of managed care, we are in <a id="page_vi"></a>danger of losing sight of the soul of therapy. Who are we? Why do we suffer? What are we seeking? This book will try to answer these questions, not through definitions but through vignettes that show how facing what we avoid leads to genuine change.</p>
<p class="indent">In these vignettes, all identifying information has either been deleted or changed to protect the confidentiality of the people involved. These stories are used to show the truths we all struggle to face and the universal ways we avoid those truths. In a sense, these stories about other people are about us. All of us struggle to face the truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the people presented here have experienced such horrendous pain that you may find their words hard to read. Your task will be to empathize with <em>their</em> pain and to recognize <em>your</em> pain through theirs. And through these stories you will see how the seemingly obvious cause for our pain is usually not the actual cause of our suffering.</p>
<p class="indent">We suffer because we run from life, death, and the teachings they offer. We become healed when we embrace our inner life, our loved ones, and life itself. Is the mystery of you knowable? No, but you are embraceable. This book will show how to embrace the truth of you.</p>
