<h2 class="h2">How We Avoid the Truth of Our Lives</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">W</span>hy do we tell ourselves lies? To avoid the feelings that arise when we face and embrace reality.</p>
<p class="indent">We often avoid the truths of our lives by waiting for fantasies to become true rather than face what is true. Waiting for what is real to become unreal is how we lie to ourselves about our loved ones, ourselves, and life itself. We suffer because we fight reality, a fight we always lose.</p>
<p class="indent">The lies we tell ourselves are invisible to us. That’s why we need a therapist to help us see those lies and the costs they inflict. Then we can begin to face the truths we avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">When we let go of the imaginary, we face the real. And by embracing our feelings and reality as they are, we not only discover who we are, but the world as it is, so we can begin to walk into it and the truths it reveals.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_26"></a>Suffering</h3>
<p class="noindent">The horrors of the tortured man and his raped and murdered wife are gruesome. Not all stories are so appalling, but this does not mean they are less moving or painful. Each story shows how therapy can free us from the illusions misguiding our lives, and invite reality, the trustworthy guide.</p>
<p class="indent">Illness reveals good health as a gift we will lose. When death “steals” our lives, it points out what we possess: nothing. Our bodies, our minds, our lives, and our loved ones appear to be ours until the last gasp exposes our ownership as a mirage. The losses of life can peel away our illusions, revealing that all is given and nothing is owned.</p>
<p class="indent">Loss is neither right nor wrong. Life is as it is prior to our opinions. We believe life should show up on our terms, but it shows up on life’s terms instead. Surprised to discover that the world is not made in our image, we judge death for interfering with our fantasies of life without loss. But no matter how much we fight reality, reality always wins.<a id="ch2notes-1"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">However, the losses of illness and death don’t always necessarily peel away our illusions about life. From the mindset of denial, death is unfair and unjust. Rather than face what is, we may choose what is not here, waiting for our fantasies to appear and make reality disappear. When we maintain our illusions, the life we have passes by while we wait for a fantasy life that never arrives. Thus, the losses of life are compounded by the losses we inflict upon ourselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Death is part of reality. We might face the death of a person, a marriage, a relationship, a career, or a dream. All our desires give birth to a death, for every desire for what is not here is fated to die when it meets the world, when the yearning for permanence meets impermanence, and when the wish for the infinite meets a limit.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_27"></a>A woman longed for her brother’s love even though he had rejected her, screamed at her, and stolen her inheritance. Unable to find his love for her, she sought it through his daughter, whom she visited and cared for. Then one day her brother told her she could no longer visit. Deprived of her last hope for a loving bond with him, the dam broke, the grief flowed, and her denial floated away.</p>
<p class="indent">Did she feel better after grieving the death of her fantasy? (She still had a relationship with her brother, just not the one she wanted.) “I have never cried like I did last session. It was so painful, but I feel relieved,” she said.</p>
<p class="indent">I asked, “What do you make of that?”</p>
<p class="indent">“After I cried I realized I could face the truth. I didn’t realize until I was crying how hard I had tried to avoid it. I knew it, but I hadn’t really faced it until last session. I don’t have to fight it anymore. I feel lighter.”</p>
<p class="indent">We get attached to fantasies of how we should be loved, respected, or desired. Our suffering is not caused by these fantasies but by our <em>attachment</em> to them. This woman was attached to her wish for a loving brother who didn’t exist. Face-to-face with a dying wish, we can either grieve as this woman did, or we can mistakenly claim life is worthless when, in fact, our self-image is. This woman realized that her love for her niece was meaningful, but her story of being a beloved sister was not. She had to grieve the losses she suffered and the ones she inflicted on herself through refusing to embrace her brother as he was.</p>
<p class="indent">Reality often disappoints whereas fantasy seduces us with the promise of infinite fulfillment. When we see a therapist, we mourn the deaths of those seductive promises. When we avoid these painful feelings, we suffer the symptoms that result from ignoring the <a id="page_28"></a>emotional truths of our lives. In therapy, we can face the feelings we have avoided and stop living in a world that no longer exists.</p>
<p class="indent">We go to a therapist to face the facts of life and the feelings they trigger; we hope therapy will make our suffering go away. And it can, but when facing the loss of our illusions, we may choose the secret protest: resignation.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Me</em>: “I give up fighting, but I still hate you.”</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Reality</em>: “Take your time. No rush. You can despise me as long as you want. People can spend an entire lifetime doing so.”</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Me</em>: “You are not fair.”</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Reality</em>: “Fair is the name you give your fantasy. You are surprised when I show up instead. You imagine your hatred will change me and undo the loss of your dreams. It’s too late. I already shattered your illusions. When you are ready, we can hold the funeral for the dead self-image lying in the coffin.”</p>
<p class="indent">What a difficult funeral to hold when we cling to a treasured self-image of one who is loved, victorious, admired, or right. These self-images are the conceptual clothes that hide who we are. Life pulls them out of our hands and we cry, but we have one more strategy for clinging to our self-image: we can treat sadness as a problem to work through and get over.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Grieving</h3>
<p class="noindent">Our grief is not a problem, however, but a path. When we grieve, we surrender to the truth that washes away the false and leaves behind the real. We do not get over grief but live through it in a communion with what is. In this communion, we need not give up our illusions since the tears wash away our attachment to the fantasies that ward off life.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_29"></a>As an example of the healing power of grief, a self-destructive man who had never met a bridge he couldn’t burn came into therapy when his world had collapsed. Facing a lifetime of self-sabotage in which he had destroyed every major relationship, he said, “I need to get past this shame and guilt.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What if they are the paths to healing? Shame is a sign from deep within that you did not live up to who you wanted to be.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s true,” he said tearfully.</p>
<p class="indent">“This guilt over the people you hurt points to your love, the higher part of yourself asking you to come home.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t think I ever tried to live up to my better self.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t need to get past the shame or guilt. You need to go through them. They are signs of who you are, the man underneath the facade of detachment.”</p>
<p class="indent">His guilt and shame did not cause his suffering; his lies did. We are never hurt by our deepest feelings, only by our resistance to them. Embracing life as it is, we bear intense pain. We believe we are dying when our fantasies are dying, removing the veils between the facts and ourselves. And at last we can rest in the truth of who we are.</p>
<p class="indent">In a later session this man grieved the ways he had destroyed earlier relationships. He saw that he had been a “phony” in life whom no one could rightly love. While sobbing over his losses and bearing the guilt over his lies, he said, “I can never thank you enough for giving me back my humanity.” In fact, I couldn’t <em>give</em> it back to him since it had always been within him, hidden under his lies.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_30"></a>The Universal Addiction</h3>
<p class="noindent">The degree of our suffering equals our distance from reality. Rather than end our suffering by running toward the truth, we run farther away from it through food, work, alcohol, drugs, and sex. Mistakenly considered addictions, they merely point to the true addiction. We are addicted to not being here. We don’t want to feel what we’re feeling. We don’t want the present but the imaginary past or future.</p>
<p class="indent">The man I described earlier who killed the murderer who killed his wife did not want to feel what he felt or remember what he remembered, but those feelings and memories were true. Killing his wife’s murderer could not unmurder his wife.</p>
<p class="indent">We are hooked on an imaginary experience of the not-me, not-now: the universal addiction. Food, drugs, Internet, sex, fame, work, and booze are tools we use to leave the real world for an imaginary world of how we think people <em>ought</em> to be. We long for an idealized past or future, which never existed. We can’t live yesterday today. Rather than be present to what <em>is</em> present, we wait for what we <em>wish</em> was present.</p>
<p class="indent">We imagine that if we lived in a different time or place, we would find our inner home of calm, rest, and contentment. Craving the not-me, not-here, and not-now keeps us homeless. We try to escape from this moment by racing to the next, but this moment is the only home we ever have.</p>
<p class="indent">We race toward another time, place, or way of being in hopes of completing ourselves, when we are already complete. Without realizing it, while running toward what we want, we leave who we are. What <em>would</em> complete us is the embrace of everything we feel now, but we do not want what is here. We want what we wish, seeking <a id="page_31"></a>the wish we prefer rather than embrace how we are. We shop for the fantasy we want, believing that what we want is faraway, when what we need to know is here.</p>
<p class="indent">We try to run from, fend off, and stop what we don’t like, racing from our fear, the beacon. Fear is a light that directs us where to dive: into our resistance. When we embrace what we fear in ourselves, the marriage between the inner self and outer self is consummated.</p>
<p class="indent">Often, however, rather than realize we are resisting feelings in ourselves, we resist the people who trigger our feelings. For instance, we resist our spouses, ignoring what they say and waiting for them to say what we want them to say. This separation from who they are, however, can lead to a divorce in our marriage. A middle-aged man wearing a baseball cap, cutoffs, and sandals sat down in my office and told me in a detached voice that his wife wanted a divorce. After years of struggle, individual therapies, and couples therapy, she had given up on the marriage, but he still wanted to try.</p>
<p class="indent">“I can’t believe she wants a divorce,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t have to believe it for her to believe it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t see why she wants a divorce.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t have to see why she wants a divorce for her to want one.”</p>
<p class="indent">He smiled. “Yeah, I know, but it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It doesn’t need to make sense to you for it to make sense to her.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t want to give up.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It may not be time to give up.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, I want this to work out.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Can we accept that you want this when she doesn’t?”</p>
<p class="indent">A hint of sadness flickered across his face. He admitted, “We took a trip with the kids recently and it was nice,” he paused, “for a day.” He paused even longer and smiled. “Until we had a fight, <a id="page_32"></a>and she said, ‘You are angry with me, aren’t you?’ And I said, ‘I despise you.’”</p>
<p class="indent">After this crack in his denial, he said, “You probably think I’m in denial, but I don’t want to give up.”</p>
<p class="indent">If I pointed out his denial, I would only reinforce his belief, but he would be no closer to seeing his own denial. I decided to play back his denial, thinking if he saw his denial in me, he would more easily see it in himself.</p>
<p class="indent">“Why give up? Maybe next week, next month, or next year will be the right time. Maybe it’s important to hold on.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sighing, he admitted, “Yeah. I mean there’s the kids and she hasn’t thought through how it’s going to work.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Given that you have kids, she hasn’t thought this through, and she asked you to move out in November; maybe you should not give up now.”</p>
<p class="indent">The smile faded from his face, and he sighed. “Several years ago she no longer wanted sex with me. She said we could stay together, but no more sex, and that’s really important to me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Although she doesn’t want sex with you anymore, and she wants a divorce, maybe you should hang on.”</p>
<p class="indent">“When we were first together, she was so sweet and caring.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What a loss! Why leave the sweet girl who cared for and loved you?” His face reddened as he looked away, tears trickling down his cheeks, leaking through his denial.</p>
<p class="indent">The separation caused his pain, and denial caused his suffering. He denied that his wife felt what she felt, thereby damaging his marriage. Rather than listen to his wife, he listened to his wish. No wonder she asked for a divorce: he had divorced her feelings and words and married his denial. Did his intercourse with denial lead her to stop sexual intercourse with him? He waited for a divorcing <a id="page_33"></a>wife to turn into a loving one, but by waiting for his wish, he forced his real wife out the door. Punishing her for failing to be his fantasy, he used guilt to bully her into becoming the woman he wanted. She left him because he had already left her for the image in his mind.</p>
<p class="indent">When he denied that his wife wanted what she wanted, I could have argued with him, but the conflict would have appeared to be between him and me. When I mirrored his denial, he experienced the conflict between his denial and reality. As a result his pain leaked through. He closed his eyes, but his wife’s wish for divorce did not disappear merely because he didn’t see it.</p>
<p class="indent">The only way she might reconsider divorcing him was if he stopped divorcing her feelings and words. She had no reason to listen to him if he listened to his denial instead of her. He could end his suffering by relating to her rather than waiting for her to become another person. He did not realize that his relation to an ideal image of his wife was an imaginary relationship.</p>
<p class="indent">He denied reality to avoid his feelings about it. The price? Ignoring his wife’s wish for a divorce did not stop her from divorcing him.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Running Away: The Geographical Cure</h3>
<p class="noindent">We rarely run away from problems outside us; we run away from the feelings in our hearts. Not realizing that we fear what’s inside us, we mistakenly fear what’s outside us. We try to run away from our problems: the geographical cure, but we cannot lift ourselves out of life. No matter where we go, our shadow follows: our feelings. Everything we run away from inside us always reaches out for our love. Yet rather than reach out to what reaches out to us, <a id="page_34"></a>we race away, refusing to sit in, rest in, and be transformed by our feelings.</p>
<p class="indent">Although we call therapy the “talking cure,” we can use words to talk away from the feelings we need to face.<a id="ch2notes-2"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes2"><sup>2</sup></a> A young woman talked to me, racing over her feelings. I interrupted and asked if she saw how quickly she was talking.</p>
<p class="indent">“I always talk like this,” she said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You race over your anxiety and feelings. What do you feel if we look underneath the words?”</p>
<p class="indent">“But I have so much to say.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Of course and can we look inside and notice what you are feeling?”</p>
<p class="indent">Her face filling with sadness, she said, “I feel nervous.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What is the feeling underneath making you nervous?”</p>
<p class="indent">She began to sob.</p>
<p class="indent">Once we stop talking away from our feelings, they rise for our embrace. We imagine we are far from what we need to heal, but we always have the exact experience we need: the one right now, the one we don’t want, the one we run from.</p>
<p class="indent">In our race to find wholeness, we forget. Trees do not rush to grow. We never pull on a bud to make it blossom. A flower never asks to be different or further along. It bears the inner pressure of life pushing the petals out to form the bloom. Have you ever taken a single rose, one that you find especially beautiful, put it in a vase, and watched several times a day as it aged? It changes but never loses its beauty, even when the last petal lies on the desk next to the vase.</p>
<p class="indent">We are more complex than a flower. Feelings reveal who we are, and if we divorce our feelings, we cut ourselves off from our depths. We sense a loss, even if we cannot name it. If we decide instead to <a id="page_35"></a>sit with the discomfort of our feelings, we can discover who we are under the words, excuses, and explanations. Can we sit with the not knowing and the desiring to know as we blossom?</p>
<p class="indent">What will happen if we open up to another person? We can’t know how we will blossom, how a relationship will bloom, how life will unfold. Can we bear not knowing who we will become?</p>
<p class="indent">To heal we must accept our fear of revealing ourselves to a person we haven’t met and our fear of <em>becoming</em> who we could be. We come to a therapist to unfold, change, and find out who we are underneath the ideas others fed us, the ideas we believed, the ideas we embody without even realizing it. Not only therapy is unknown. <em>We</em> are the uncharted territory never explored, the potential never plumbed.</p>
<p class="indent">How can we judge addicts? We are addicted to not bearing what we feel or being who we are. We are stoned on imaginary selves, imaginary others, and imaginary states of mind: the real drugs.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately for our growth, life shows up instead. Ever faithful, it rises every day to be seen and embraced, triggering feelings and our opposition to what is. Reality invites us to reunite with the external world.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapist makes a similar invitation: “Are you willing to face and embrace who you are so you can heal?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t want to be me. I am addicted to the image I want to become.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Your addiction is not the problem. Accepting your addiction is the next step toward the wholeness you seek. How you are is what we need to embrace.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I hoped I could divorce my addiction.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. You hoped you could divorce your outer life and inner life, but they are married to you forever.”</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_36"></a>The Universal Lies in Life and Therapy</h3>
<p class="noindent">To reject our inner life and outer life, we need to lie. But this lie is different, universal, and even invisible to us: it is a defense. As the psychoanalyst Donald Meltzer said, defenses are the lies we tell ourselves to avoid pain.<a id="ch2notes-3"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A woman who was betrayed by an unfaithful husband said, “He shouldn’t have done that!” (Lie: reality should not be what reality is.) A man who was physically abused as a child by his father said, “I’m glad my father beat me. I deserved it.” (Lie: I pretend that only my love exists and not my rage toward my father.) A woman whose husband had left her said he will come back. (Lie: if I unsay reality, reality will disappear.)</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine a woman who distanced herself in relationships, remaining lonely, isolated, and depressed. I asked, “What is the feeling toward your husband for having an affair?” She answered, “I feel empty.”</p>
<p class="indent">Without realizing it, she lied to herself and to me. Can I relate to an empty woman? Or should I point out how she hides behind her facade of emptiness? Do I believe her lie? Given enough pain, all of us have pretended to be empty when we were <em>full</em> of feelings. None of us are in a position to judge others for hiding their feelings.</p>
<p class="indent">She emptied herself, inviting me to relate to an empty woman in an empty relationship. In response, whether as friends or as therapists, we must embrace a fact: she lied. She has feelings because we always do. She just hides them from other people. Why?</p>
<p class="indent">As children, we hide our inner life to cling to a parent we cannot share the truth with.<a id="ch2notes-4"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes4"><sup>4</sup></a> When we share a feeling, we share the truth of our experience in this moment. If a parent becomes angry or anxious when we express a feeling, we learn to hide our feelings <a id="page_37"></a>to make a parent less anxious and to preserve our relationship. This woman learned to pretend her feelings had disappeared, acquiring this language of concealment as seamlessly as she did her mother tongue. The problem is that our feelings do not disappear only because we hide them.</p>
<p class="indent">This woman’s close relationships in the past led to pain. Since her mother had distanced from her, the woman distanced from her own feelings and from me. However, her problem, distancing, is also her gift to us: she shows in the present how others hurt her in the past. In this way, obstacles to love reveal the wounds to be healed.</p>
<p class="indent">She expected me to accept the empty relationship with her that she had to accept as a child. But if I accepted her “emptiness,” we’d have an empty relationship. Instead of accepting the relationship she offers, which harms her, I offered a relationship that heals.</p>
<p class="indent">When she said she felt empty, I responded, “You say you feel empty, inviting me to relate to an empty woman. Then we will have an empty relationship. You put up a wall of emptiness between you and me. What feelings are coming up toward me that make you create this barrier?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m not sure I want to work with you.”</p>
<p class="indent">She threatened to leave if I was honest, like her mother threatened her. Hearing her threat, I said, “It sounds like you have a reaction to what I said. What are you feeling toward me?”</p>
<p class="indent">When people threaten us when we are honest, we might agree with their lie to avoid a conflict with them. But by embracing a person’s lie, we become in conflict with the truth, when the person’s lie should be in conflict with reality. If we embrace that lie, we abandon the person.</p>
<p class="indent">When I asked what she felt, she said, “I don’t think I have a feeling. I mean I could throw out something, but it wouldn’t be real.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_38"></a>“Right. You invite me to relate to an imaginary person to have an unreal relationship. This is a barrier you put up between us. What is your feeling toward me that makes you create this wall of the unreal person?”</p>
<p class="indent">In therapy we often discover that people were given the message as children, “Lie, and I will love you. Tell the truth, and I will leave you.” If not said in words, it is often said in action. In response, the child may sacrifice her integrity, honesty, and even her sanity, for the love of the parent she needs to survive. Many of us go on to live lives that embody that destructive message.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether as therapists or friends, we should live the message “Because I care for you, I will be honest. If you shame me, I will not borrow your shame. You accuse me of hurting you, but your lies hurt you. Truth, being the food of the soul, can never damage you, but the falseness that hides who you really are is poisoning your soul.”<a id="ch2notes-5"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">All of us lie. The moment we invite a person to be close, the age-old question returns: “Can I tell you what others could not bear, or must I hide what I feel?” In the past, we had to live a lie. The therapist invites us to let go of our lies, so we can live the truth together.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Love Addiction or Addiction to Denial?</h3>
<p class="noindent">We try to run away from our feelings, but we can never escape who we are. Nor can we escape from what is happening in this moment, except through imagination. Yet when facing the loss of a past love, an imaginary love can be seductive.</p>
<p class="indent">A man sought therapy to let go of his ex-girlfriend. “I know that holding on to her hurts me, but I can’t stop waiting for her. I don’t want to say goodbye to the chance that she still wants me.” He paused and wondered, “Maybe I’m addicted to her.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_39"></a>Yes, he was addicted, not to her but to denial. He could have related to the fact that she left him. Instead, he interacted with his fantasy: “She’ll come back.” To fend off his feelings due to the breakup, he denied what happened and tried to live in his wish.</p>
<p class="indent">The object of his addiction was not his ex-girlfriend. She vanished. He was addicted to his <em>fantasy</em>: an imaginary woman who wanted to unsay her words, retrace her steps, and live happily ever after with a man she abandoned.</p>
<p class="indent">“I want her back,” he said.</p>
<p class="indent">“You wish the girl who left would return. Who wouldn’t want a rejecting girlfriend to turn into a lover? Why let go of that?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I know it’s negative if I hang on.”</p>
<p class="indent">To help him see his illogic, I enacted it so he could see it and hear it outside of himself: “If you hang on to a rejecter, she might turn into an accepter. What’s negative about that?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t want to wait for her. I can’t help it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You can’t help wanting the image in your mind instead of your rejecting girlfriend. It’s important to love her while she rejects you. Can we accept that?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t want to say goodbye to the chance she still wants me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t want to say goodbye to the chance she will turn into someone else.”</p>
<p class="indent">“The memories of the good times hurt.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. The memories remind you that you are waiting for the woman who left. And waiting for what is gone hurts you.”</p>
<p class="indent">When she rejected him, he rejected the facts and waited for her to unreject him. If we wait for the universe to do things our way, we had better have ten thousand lifetimes. Standing by the roadside with his thumb out, life was passing him by while he waited for a fantasy that never came. “Reality is painful, but denial is <a id="page_40"></a>dangerous.”<a id="ch2notes-6"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes6"><sup>6</sup></a> If we wait for the life we want, we lose the life we have. By facing the reality of loss, we can grieve what has passed, and embrace what is left.</p>
<p class="indent">In the throes of desire, we assume that the facts can be other than they are in this moment. This man was not addicted to love but to a nonexistent girlfriend who would unring the bell, make time rewind, and resume a life of loving bliss. Denial was his drug of choice.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Optimal Hopelessness</h3>
<p class="noindent">As a drug of choice, denial is useless. No matter how much we deny what is happening, it still happens. Why? Denial is a thought. Can a thought know reality? Can a thought replace what is here? Can a thought make a fact disappear? Sometimes it seems worth a try, especially when, for example, a husband uses his wife.</p>
<p class="indent">A woman was angry because her husband no longer paid for house expenses nor wore his wedding ring. She told me she wanted to mention the money to him for the thousandth time but felt hopeless.</p>
<p class="indent">“That makes sense. Would you agree that bringing it up again <em>is</em> hopeless?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I can’t believe he doesn’t pay his share of the expenses.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s okay. You don’t have to believe it for it to exist.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t get it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You don’t get reality.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I keep hoping he will change.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You keep hoping the reality of your husband will change.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Shouldn’t he want to pay for his children?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Shouldn’t he be the same as you want him to be?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_41"></a>“It would be nice.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, it would. We can wish this were true, but it’s not. We can rage at what no longer exists, or we can take another path. Giving up on this road doesn’t mean you give up on yourself or on life. It means taking another path.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I get it. I have to face reality.”</p>
<p class="indent">To hope that the real will become unreal is not hope but denial. Life bumps into our illusion and reveals that resisting facts is futile. This woman was not hopeless, nor was her husband. Her delusion was. We don’t need to give up on a person or on ourselves but on a hopeless <em>fantasy</em>. Then our suffering stops. She needed to stop waiting for her husband to turn into her fantasy in order to release herself from her suffering.</p>
<p class="indent">We rage, hoping life will turn into our wish. The result is a sore throat. Life still exists as it is. Once we accept that our wish is a fantasy, we rest in optimal hopelessness: we recognize that it is hopeless to wait for what is true to become not true.</p>
<p class="indent">When we let go of the imaginary offerings of our illusions, we become open to the real offerings of life. As the philosopher Ernst Bloch points out, genuine hope occurs when we reach out to find what <em>has</em> been stretching toward us.<a id="ch2notes-7"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes7"><sup>7</sup></a> When we reach out to the real, we feel hope in the possible. At that moment we seem to expand. Hope does not expand us, however. Hope reveals the expanse that lives outside our fantasies, the inner expanse that we are but had forgotten.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapist helps us see the lies that blind us into hopelessness so we can see what is real, pursue it, and regain our hope. The moment we leave the path of denial, the path to the possible opens. We must give up hope in hopeless fantasies to regain realistic hope in what is real.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_42"></a>I Can’t Stand It!</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rather than embrace what is and let our illusions dissolve, we ask life to wait until we can “handle” it. For instance, we claim that “this is too much,” we are “not ready,” or “what happened should not have happened.”</p>
<p class="indent">An outraged businessman said, “I can’t stand it! She knew what she was doing, and it was wrong!” He had ignored his wife and her complaints. Then she had an affair.</p>
<p class="indent">We say we can’t stand it, but we do. “I can’t stand it,” means, “I don’t want to.” Who does?</p>
<p class="indent">Life seems to be against us. Yet since we are life, we cannot separate ourselves from it. Life includes us. What is “against life” is our belief that life should be the same as our fantasy.</p>
<p class="indent">Our beliefs always lose because life doesn’t obey our orders. It may appear that it is too much for us, but it’s not. Life is too much for our beliefs, shattering them every day—if we’re lucky. As they shatter, we mistakenly think we are falling apart, but our fantasies, masquerading as our essence, are dissolving into nothingness.</p>
<p class="indent">And who better to shatter our fantasies than a child not living up to our hopes. A mother had failed to protect her son adequately from an abusive father. Later in life, the son blackmailed the mother into supporting him financially, claiming that <em>his</em> problems were <em>her</em> fault. He kept browbeating her until she broke down and coughed up more cash. As I showed her how he blackmailed her, the ways she tried to purchase his forgiveness, and how her bid to “buy peace” bought more war, she said, “This is killing me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. This is killing your illusions.”</p>
<p class="indent">She nodded, pursed her lips, and burst into tears. “But I don’t want the relationship to be harmed.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_43"></a>“How can you harm something that no longer exists?”</p>
<p class="indent">She related to the imaginary son she wanted, not the real son she had. And she wished he would relate to her, not to the projection he had placed upon her. He viewed her as an evil person who deserved to suffer for eternity and should pay reparations until death. She feared the good relationship she desired would be harmed, but it didn’t exist and hadn’t existed for decades. He saw an image, not her. She saw an image, not him, for she longed for a loving son, the one who had disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">As we let go of our illusions, we can live the truth we feared. When this woman gave up waiting for the son she wanted, she stopped trying to buy his love, and loved the real son she had instead. The blackmail came to an end.</p>
<p class="indent">Before burying our dead hopes, we may stage another protest: “Why does this happen?” Translation: “Why does reality happen to me?” Life whispers, “Why not? I happen to everyone else. It’s nothing personal.”</p>
<p class="indent">Take me, for example. I used to say, “I never get sick.” Then I was diagnosed with cancer. My fantasy, previously viewed as a fact, fell into the psychic trash bin. I didn’t fall apart; my thought did. Tumors didn’t need to fit my mind to grow in my body.</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t understand why this is happening,” we say. That’s okay. Whatever is happening does not need our understanding. It exists whether we understand it or not. Not registering the facts, we try to bargain with the universe, hoping life will say, “You don’t get it? Fine. I won’t show up until you do.”</p>
<p class="indent">One way we fight facts is by refusing to understand our spouses and asking them to explain themselves until we do. An irritated wife asked her husband, “Why do you spend so much time playing online chess?”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_44"></a>“I enjoy it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“It doesn’t make sense. It’s a waste of time. It’s not productive.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Look. I have done my chores. I have free time. I enjoy this. How do I get you off my back?”</p>
<p class="indent">“You have to convince me why it’s a good idea.”</p>
<p class="indent">It was not his job to convince her why he liked what she didn’t like. She tried to bully her husband by not understanding him, hoping he would say, “You don’t understand me? Okay. I’ll stop being me until you understand why I have a right not to be you.”</p>
<p class="indent">She gave him the message “How can I manipulate you to want what I want? If I can dominate you, my problems are over.” This strategy always fails because differences never end. We want the whole person without the parts we don’t like, but the parts make the whole.</p>
<p class="indent">Our spouses will never shrink to match our understanding nor stretch to fit our fantasies. Why? Reality, being everything, includes our fantasies, whereas fantasies are <em>designed to exclude</em> what is real. We fail to realize that we want to change a fact, a fact that continues to exist—for instance, the fact that a husband likes chess. Devoted to our fantasies, we avoid facing what is here.</p>
<p class="indent">A woman argued with her deadbeat husband who refused to look for a job. For years, she berated him for his behavior. She even relished a secret pride in “fighting the good fight” for her daughters. What did her fight achieve? She showed her daughters how to stay with a neglectful partner, wait for him to change, complain that he was not changing, and be proud of her choice to suffer: the heroism of masochism.</p>
<p class="indent">We ask people and life to change to be the way we want, and they do change. But they change their way, not ours. When they don’t change our way, our illusions can dissolve or we can hold on to them more fiercely. If our illusions dissolve, we feel pain.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_45"></a>While bearing the loss of our dreams, we need not be strong. We need only stand still without running while the true burns off the false.<a id="ch2notes-8"></a><a class="nounder" href="notes.html#ch2notes8"><sup>8</sup></a> Hopes, thoughts, and ideas are so many moths burning up in the flame of life.</p>
<p class="indent">We hope to control what is, but we are like a wave trying to shove the river of life. The river is still here after the wave dies on the shore. We try to reject what is, but it cannot reject us. It always embraces us, try as we might to wriggle out. Can we accept reality’s embrace and return it?</p>
<h3 class="h3">Resistance = Suffering</h3>
<p class="noindent">When we embrace life, we cannot avoid pain. It is inevitable. We will lose everything we have and everyone we love before or at the moment of death.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, suffering is optional. Experiencing heartbreak, we may use defenses, the lies we tell ourselves to avoid the pain life brings. But our defenses—the ways we avoid reality—cause more suffering. We push away what is happening and the resulting feelings. “I’m not angry, just disappointed.” “I can’t believe it!” “She couldn’t have meant that.” Yet life keeps leaking through.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember the hallucinating woman whose husband left her? Facing <em>his</em> betrayal and the pain it caused was the easy part. Later in therapy we discovered that for years she had complained about the ways he treated her but then she waited for him to become someone else.</p>
<p class="indent">The hard part was facing how she had rejected him for years and blamed him for not being the way she wanted him to be. In fact, she had not been married to him but to the image she wanted him to become. Thus, she had divorced him years before <a id="page_46"></a>without realizing it. Waiting for him to turn into someone else, she deprived and punished herself, calling it loyalty. She never realized that loyalty to the unreal was betrayal of herself.</p>
<p class="indent">At first, she thought he had been cruel to her. Eventually, she realized she had been cruel to him and to herself. Her task was to embrace the facts: he had left her, and she had left him, herself, and her feelings.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking responsibility for the life <em>we created</em> is hard when playing the victim is so easy: “<em>They</em> created my life!” The siren song of victimhood sounds so sweet, pure, and righteous as it lures us out of the river of life. We retreat into a netherworld where others are bad, we are good, and all is perfectly clear. Lost within our fantasies, we forget who we are: the space in which those illusions arise.</p>
<p class="indent">In the reassuring certainty of victimhood, we <em>know</em> what they did, <em>why</em> they did it, and what they <em>should</em> have done. All this “knowledge,” seemingly simple, true, and obvious, is merely our assumptions, factual only within the fantasy world dreaming between our ears. In fact, we never plumb the depths of another person completely. Since our understanding of others is always incomplete and partial, our “knowledge” is always a lie: a splinter masquerading as the tree.</p>
<p class="indent">And the “shoulds” are our directives to the universe. We tell people how they <em>should</em> be according to us, but the cosmos never notices; it goes its own way—not ours. Life keeps bumping into our shoulds: our fantasies of how we wish life would be.</p>
<p class="indent">When we expect what we want instead of life, we feel victimized by life, unaware of how we create our suffering. A depressed woman, furious with her husband, said he was insensitive, thoughtless, and cruel. I asked for an example. Through her tears she described how her husband had put his fist into her anus during lovemaking, <a id="page_47"></a>causing excruciating pain. Horrified, I explored what happened and was shocked again: her husband asked permission to insert his fist into her anus during their lovemaking, and she gave her consent.</p>
<p class="indent">“He put his fist in my anus, and it hurt,” she said.</p>
<p class="indent">“He put his fist in your anus. Is that true?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes. I told you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“May I offer you a different perspective?” “Go ahead.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He asked you whether he could put his fist in your anus, right?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You could have said no, but you said yes.”</p>
<p class="indent">“He didn’t want me to say no.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Right. You said no to yourself instead.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Oh.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You told him he could put his fist in your anus. In effect, <em>you</em> put his fist in your anus because you told him he could, but you blame him for your choice. You said no to yourself, and you blame him for that choice. Do you see what I mean?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I didn’t think of it.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If we think of it that way, what did you feel toward him when he asked to put his fist in your anus?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I didn’t like the idea.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But your feeling toward him?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I was angry.”</p>
<p class="indent">“You were angry with him. Then you dealt with your anger by turning it on yourself by inviting him to hurt you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I forgot that I was angry with him.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Right. You felt angry with him, forgot your anger, and turned it on yourself by inviting him to hurt you. It was as if you invited him to punish you for being angry with him.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>“And later I invited him to criticize the food I made for dinner.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes. You invited him to punish you again for being angry. Is it possible that the person who is being cruel to you is you?”</p>
<p class="indent">She had been convinced <em>he</em> was cruel, <em>he</em> should be more sensitive, <em>he</em> should be more thoughtful. Yet by inviting him to hurt her, she had been cruel, insensitive, and thoughtless toward herself. In this victim stance, she asked him to love her when she refused to love herself. This strategy was doomed to fail because <em>his</em> love could never erase <em>her</em> self-hatred.</p>
<p class="indent">With the collapse of our imaginary victimhood, we see how we victimized ourselves, and the grief flows, revealing who we are.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of giving up on our fantasies, however, we may mistakenly give up on life. A woman in an abusive relationship asked, “Am I supposed to give up on my husband?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No, but you may want to give up on your self-punishment.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Am I supposed to change?”</p>
<p class="indent">“It’s not a matter of whether you are supposed to change, but whether you want to.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Supposed to” is a hidden violence, an inner directive to do what we don’t want to do, feel what we don’t feel, and be who we are not. The best we can do in the moment may be to accept that we want to reject reality and cling to our illusions a little longer.</p>
<p class="indent">We can cling to illusions by asking our spouses to change into our favorite fantasies. A woman on her second marriage complained about her husband’s habits of watching television, buying DVDs, and spending time on charity work. She admitted that he was a good husband, but she kept trying to convince him that his hobbies were wrong. These arguments had escalated until her husband had threatened divorce, another deed he <em>should not</em> have done.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>“How can I convince him that he is wrong to spend all his time watching football on the weekends?” she asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“Since he likes watching football, why shouldn’t he like what he likes?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Do you watch football?”</p>
<p class="indent">“No. Since he likes football, why shouldn’t he like watching it?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Because it’s a waste of time.”</p>
<p class="indent">“According to who?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Me.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Right. Since it’s a waste of time for you, you shouldn’t watch football. Since it’s a pleasure for him, he should.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But I can’t stand it!”</p>
<p class="indent">“Maybe he’s right. If you can’t stand him the way he is, you should let him go, so he can find a woman who can love him the way he is.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I give up!”</p>
<p class="indent">“That makes sense. Either you give up your wish for a man who wants what <em>you</em> want or you will have to give up your husband. You cannot avoid divorce. Either you divorce your fantasy of sameness or he’ll divorce you because I’m willing to bet another woman will love him in spite of his wish to watch football on Sunday.”</p>
<p class="indent">She wanted to control her husband to make him fit an image in her mind. But we never control reality, which never fits the images in our mind. When we swear off our fantasies, we unite with what is. Until then, the suffering caused by our resistance whispers to us: “You are lost in your fantasies; come home.”</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_50"></a>Dancing on the Table</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rather than come home to a painful truth, we try to get rid of it. During a dinner years ago, an acquaintance of mine asked her husband, my wife, and me, “What would you ask for if you could have anything in the world?” We thought for a minute and answered. When her turn came, she said, “I have no need to dance on the table since I’ve been analyzed.”</p>
<p class="indent">I was puzzled by her comment at first until I realized what she meant. She wasn’t playing the game she had started. We revealed our desires; she didn’t. Then we learned a troubling truth. She believed psychoanalysis had purified her of neurosis, replacing her old personality. We had desires; she supposedly didn’t. I was angry that she had set us up and troubled by her yearning to be purified, thus boring.</p>
<p class="indent">She imagined that she needed to get rid of who she was to become who she wanted to be. A soul sister, she was showing me what I wanted from therapy too! Instead, we must let go of who we wish we were to be the presence we are.</p>
<p class="indent">Although therapists sometimes view psychotherapy as a modern “technology,” the word “psychology” originally meant the study of the soul. Why did her study of the soul turn into her contempt for it? She didn’t realize that to heal, we must embrace our inner messes, not eradicate them.</p>
<p class="indent">If a man confesses that he has been a petty thief, shall I condemn his conditioning or embrace it and the person underneath? Can I allow a shoplifter to touch and move me? Can I find wishes to steal within myself? What if he is showing me aspects of myself that I fear to face?</p>
<p class="indent">Healing occurs when we love our depths no matter how messy and pathological. Remember the joke: what is psychotherapy? It’s <a id="page_51"></a>when a big mess meets a littler mess. Our raw vulnerability to life never goes away. Our task is not to eliminate but to embrace our humanity, often through embracing the humanity of others.</p>
<p class="indent">What do I doom within myself when I refuse your humanity? Your flaws are the mirrors in which I see myself. When I look into you, can I embrace your “defects,” meaning what I reject in myself? When I do, you and I discover one less dividing line between us. With every yes, we step closer toward embracing the other person’s depths, which are, in the end, our own.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Zero Negativity</h3>
<p class="noindent">At a conference a presenter described his goal for marriages: zero negativity—a relationship with no conflicts. I like science fiction too, but conflict is embedded in our lives. We have conflicting desires within ourselves and between each other. We always have different desires because I am not you, and you are not me. That’s not a problem, but how we are made.</p>
<p class="indent">I told a friend that zero negativity was a fantasy of returning to the womb. He corrected me. Even there we find negativity: the fetus ingests drugs her mother takes, and the mother is exhausted in the act of giving birth. We seek idyllic, nonexistent forms of closeness without conflict.</p>
<p class="indent">Do I wish everyone agreed with me? Yes. Does that happen? No. Is that negative? Not to my growth. If I step out of myself and let go of my other-image (my secret demands of others), I learn to accept people as they are. This is the first step toward love.</p>
<p class="indent">We long for a world where everyone gets along and the lion and lamb lie down together. What a beautiful story! When life shows up instead, we become angry. “My preference did not happen!” <a id="page_52"></a>We want an imaginary world to avoid the real world. We yearn for spouses who want what we want, groups who cooperate, and colleagues who agree. “Don’t be who you are. Be who I want you to be.” We compare what happens with what we think should be happening and try to escape into our wishes.</p>
<p class="indent">Our demand for zero negativity reveals a negative mindset within ourselves. If I want no conflict, I don’t want you. Is there room for you <em>and</em> me? Is there room in me for the truth of you? If the universe has accepted positivity <em>and</em> negativity, why don’t we?</p>
<p class="indent">I go for a walk. I see the sun, the moon, and the stars. Looking down, I see dog feces on my shoe. In therapy we look inside ourselves and discover a landscape equally inclusive.</p>
<p class="indent">We are made messy, but we try to reject any part of reality that does not fit what we want. When we decide what we will accept and dismiss the rest, we sentence parts of ourselves to death row. We try to sanitize ourselves to appear like the purified pictures in our minds. This is not love, but hatred of life. When we try to transcend life, we reject it.</p>
<p class="indent">To aim for zero negativity, we must reject the negative in ourselves. A priest confided his self-hatred to me. I asked, “According to your theology, God made you in God’s image. Is that right?” He nodded. “And from your point of view, does God love you?” He nodded. “Since God made you in his image and loves you, wouldn’t it make sense to join Him by loving yourself?” His eyes filled with tears.</p>
