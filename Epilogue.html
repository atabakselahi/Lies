<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">I</span> can still picture the breeze blowing through the window, curtains swaying, cords hanging, the windowsill gnawed at by tiny teeth. I hear the voices and screams of the past. This window of death is also a portal to life. Each of us is a window through which the truth blows, and every gust of wind is another death. This openness, this yes-ness: the surrender to what is. Do I believe in the awareness that is the embrace? Maybe the day my brother died I heard the song of the wind within. I learned that awareness is not what we do, but who we are. Each of us is a window of awareness, the emptiness in which the truth is revealed. We live in and as the mystery. We are the embrace.<a id="page_158"></a></p>
