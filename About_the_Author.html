<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcaps">F</span>rom the age of six years old, Jon Frederickson grew up working in his fatherâ€™s blacksmith shop in Clear Lake, Iowa. There he worked with his father at the forge and welder, fixing farm implements, and creating wrought iron railings. Although his parents hoped he would take over the shop one day, a music teacher convinced them that Jon had the talent to become a musician and should go on to college. He graduated from college and became a professional musician, playing the French horn. After having received the help of a therapist, he decided to become one. While performing music at night, he went to graduate school during the day and became a social worker and psychotherapist. He worked at a mental health clinic, a counseling center, and later entered private practice.</p>
<p class="indent">To further his training, he applied to enter a psychoanalytic institute. But he was informed that they were not sure he was analyzable, due to the traumas in his childhood. He was surprised that he was being evaluated in terms of what had been done to him in the past, not what he had done with his past. He realized how important it is that no person be viewed in terms of what is impersonal, what has been done to us. Instead, we should be judged on what is personal, what we were able to do with the cards we were dealt. He had a new appreciation for the acts of will by which we create ourselves and give meaning to our lives. And this experience gave him new appreciation for the role of hope in life and therapy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_168"></a>As a faculty member of the Washington School of Psychiatry, he has taught psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. Currently, he teaches mental health professionals around the world, showing videotapes of his own work. His life ambition has been to teach therapy as well as his father taught blacksmithing and his music teachers taught the French horn.</p>
<p class="indent">Before writing this book for the general public, he authored two books and over thirty articles on psychotherapy. His previous book for therapists was the award winning, <em>Co-Creating Change: Effective Dynamic Therapy Techniques</em>.</p>
